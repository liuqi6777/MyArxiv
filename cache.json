To this end, researchers have proposed several techniques\nto explain model predictions. However, practitioners struggle to use these\nexplainability techniques because they often do not know which one to choose\nand how to interpret the results of the explanations. In this work, we address\nthese challenges by introducing TalkToModel: an interactive dialogue system for\nexplaining machine learning models through conversations. Specifically,\nTalkToModel comprises of three key components: 1) a natural language interface\nfor engaging in conversations, making ML model explainability highly\naccessible, 2) a dialogue engine that adapts to any tabular model and dataset,\ninterprets natural language, maps it to appropriate explanations, and generates\ntext responses, and 3) an execution component that constructs the explanations.\nWe carried out extensive quantitative and human subject evaluations of\nTalkToModel. Overall, we found the conversational system understands user\ninputs on novel datasets and models with high accuracy, demonstrating the\nsystem's capacity to generalize to new situations. In real-world evaluations\nwith humans, 73% of healthcare workers (e.g., doctors and nurses) agreed they\nwould use TalkToModel over baseline point-and-click systems for explainability\nin a disease prediction task, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel\nwas easier to use for computing explanations.

While it has shown remarkable\nperformance even in unseen situations, it often performs in ways not intuitive\nto humans. Particularly, they usually do not consider the pronunciation of the\ninput, which humans would utilize to understand language, especially when it\ncomes to unknown words. Thus, this paper inserts phonetic prior into\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), one of the V\\&L pretrained\nmodels, to make it consider the pronunciation similarity among its\npronunciation inputs. To achieve this, we first propose a phoneme embedding\nthat utilizes the phoneme relationships provided by the International Phonetic\nAlphabet (IPA) chart as a phonetic prior. Next, by distilling the frozen CLIP\ntext encoder, we train a pronunciation encoder employing the IPA-based\nembedding. The proposed model named IPA-CLIP comprises this pronunciation\nencoder and the original CLIP encoders (image and text). Quantitative\nevaluation reveals that the phoneme distribution on the embedding space\nrepresents phonetic relationships more accurately when using the proposed\nphoneme embedding. Furthermore, in some multimodal retrieval tasks, we confirm\nthat the proposed pronunciation encoder enhances the performance of the text\nencoder and that the pronunciation encoder handles nonsense words in a more\nphonetic manner than the text encoder. Finally, qualitative evaluation verifies\nthe correlation between the pronunciation encoder and human perception\nregarding pronunciation similarity.\n","authors":["Chihaya Matsuhira","Marc A.

This decoder is both data-efficient\nand computation-efficient: 1) it only requires the text data for training,\neasing the burden on the collection of paired data. 2) it does not require\nend-to-end training. When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the\ntext embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix\nembedding. The challenge is that the decoder is trained on the text corpus but\nat the inference stage, it needs to generate captions based on visual inputs.\nThe modality gap issue is widely observed in multi-modal contrastive models\nthat prevents us from directly taking the visual embedding as the prefix\nembedding.

It is difficult to diagnose and\ncontinues to be underdiagnosed. Because depressed patients constantly share\ntheir symptoms, major life events, and treatments on social media, researchers\nare turning to user-generated digital traces on social media for depression\ndetection. Such methods have distinct advantages in combating depression\nbecause they can facilitate innovative approaches to fight depression and\nalleviate its social and economic burden. However, most existing studies lack\neffective means to incorporate established medical domain knowledge in\ndepression detection or suffer from feature extraction difficulties that impede\ngreater performance. Following the design science research paradigm, we propose\na Deep Knowledge-aware Depression Detection (DKDD) framework to accurately\ndetect social media users at risk of depression and explain the critical\nfactors that contribute to such detection. Extensive empirical studies with\nreal-world data demonstrate that, by incorporating domain knowledge, our method\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work has significant\nimplications for IS research in knowledge-aware machine learning, digital\ntraces utilization, and NLP research in IS. Practically, by providing early\ndetection and explaining the critical factors, DKDD can supplement clinical\ndepression screening and enable large-scale evaluations of a population's\nmental health status.\n","authors":["Wenli Zhang","Jiaheng Xie","Xiang Liu","Zhu Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05389v1.pdf","comment":"Presented at INFORMS 2022 Data Science Workshop"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05382v1","updated":"2023-03-06T16:36:17Z","published":"2023-03-06T16:36:17Z","title":"ChatGPT is on the horizon: Could a large language model be all we need\n  for Intelligent Transportation?","summary":"  ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is one of the largest Large Language Models\n(LLM) with over 175 billion parameters.

The presence\nof slap images in a real-world dataset where one or more fingerprints are\nrotated makes it challenging for a biometric recognition system to localize and\nlabel the fingerprints automatically. Improper fingerprint localization and\nfinger labeling errors lead to poor matching performance. In this paper, we\nintroduce a method to generate arbitrary angled bounding boxes using a deep\nlearning-based algorithm that precisely localizes and labels fingerprints from\nboth axis-aligned and over-rotated slap images.

Although\nTransformer-based methods eliminate the heuristic post-processing, they still\nsuffer from the synergy issue between the sub-tasks and low training\nefficiency. In this paper, we present DeepSolo, a simple DETR-like baseline\nthat lets a single Decoder with Explicit Points Solo for text detection and\nrecognition simultaneously. Technically, for each text instance, we represent\nthe character sequence as ordered points and model them with learnable explicit\npoint queries. After passing a single decoder, the point queries have encoded\nrequisite text semantics and locations, thus can be further decoded to the\ncenter line, boundary, script, and confidence of text via very simple\nprediction heads in parallel. Besides, we also introduce a text-matching\ncriterion to deliver more accurate supervisory signals, thus enabling more\nefficient training. Quantitative experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate\nthat DeepSolo outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and achieves better\ntraining efficiency.

Specifically, FRPT\nonly needs to learn fewer parameters in the prompt and adaptation instead of\nfine-tuning the entire model, thus solving the issue of convergence to\nsuboptimal solutions caused by fine-tuning the entire model.

In this way, DPP can make the fine-grained retrieval task\naided by the perturbation prompts close to the solved task during the original\npre-training.

The DwinFormer consists of dual window\nself-attention and cross-attention transformers, Dwin-SAT and Dwin-CAT,\nrespectively.

Because of the ducts' tiny sizes, slender tubular structures and the\nsurrounding distractions, most current researches on pancreatic duct\nsegmentation achieve low accuracy and always have segmentation errors on the\nterminal parts of the ducts. To address these problems, we propose a terminal\nguidance mechanism called cascaded terminal guidance network (CTG-Net).\nFirstly, a terminal attention mechanism is established on the skeletons\nextracted from the coarse predictions. Then, to get fine terminal segmentation,\na subnetwork is designed for jointly learning the local intensity from the\noriginal images, feature cues from coarse predictions and global anatomy\ninformation from the pancreas distance transform maps. Finally, a terminal\ndistraction attention module which explicitly learns the distribution of the\nterminal distraction is proposed to reduce the false positive and false\nnegative predictions.

Importantly, to be used in\ncommon 3D applications, the reconstructed shapes need to be represented as\npolygonal meshes, which is a challenge for neural networks due to the\nirregularity of mesh tessellations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive\nreview of mesh reconstruction methods that are powered by machine learning. We\nfirst describe various representations for 3D shapes in the deep learning\ncontext. Then we review the development of 3D mesh reconstruction methods from\nvoxels, point clouds, single images, and multi-view images. Finally, we\nidentify several challenges in this field and propose potential future\ndirections.\n","authors":["Zhiqin Chen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02879v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10907v2","updated":"2023-03-06T03:54:48Z","published":"2022-09-22T10:29:17Z","title":"DRKF: Distilled Rotated Kernel Fusion for Efficient Rotation Invariant\n  Descriptors in Local Feature Matching","summary":"  The performance of local feature descriptors degrades in the presence of\nlarge rotation variations.

Second, our novel\nself-distilled regularization controls the output of the meta networks not to\ndeviate significantly from the output of the frozen original networks, thereby\npreserving well-trained knowledge from the source domain.

Therefore, a new dedicated\nmethod is needed for ORSI-SOD.

To address these issues, we propose\na novel method called Dual Feedback Attention Framework via Boundary-Aware\nAuxiliary and Progressive Semantic Optimization (DFA-BASO).

An area of significant interest has been using deep-learning\n(DL)-based approaches for denoising images acquired with lower doses, shorter\nacquisition times, or both. Objective evaluation of these approaches is\nessential for clinical application. DL-based approaches for denoising\nnuclear-medicine images have typically been evaluated using fidelity-based\nfigures of merit (FoMs) such as RMSE and SSIM. However, these images are\nacquired for clinical tasks and thus should be evaluated based on their\nperformance in these tasks. Our objectives were to (1) investigate whether\nevaluation with these FoMs is consistent with objective clinical-task-based\nevaluation; (2) provide a theoretical analysis for determining the impact of\ndenoising on signal-detection tasks; (3) demonstrate the utility of virtual\nclinical trials (VCTs) to evaluate DL-based methods. A VCT to evaluate a\nDL-based method for denoising myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) images was\nconducted. The impact of DL-based denoising was evaluated using fidelity-based\nFoMs and AUC, which quantified performance on detecting perfusion defects in\nMPS images as obtained using a model observer with anthropomorphic channels.\nBased on fidelity-based FoMs, denoising using the considered DL-based method\nled to significantly superior performance. However, based on ROC analysis,\ndenoising did not improve, and in fact, often degraded detection-task\nperformance. The results motivate the need for objective task-based evaluation\nof DL-based denoising approaches. Further, this study shows how VCTs provide a\nmechanism to conduct such evaluations using VCTs.

The dynamic background images are obtained by thresholding\nthe background-subtracted images. The second network is a U-Net that uses the\nsame object-free video for training and the dynamic background images as\npixel-wise ground-truth labels. During the test phase, the input images are\nprocessed by the autoencoder and U-Net, which generate background and dynamic\nbackground images, respectively.

Currently, unsupervised out-of-distribution detection is\ndominated by generative-based approaches that make use of estimates of the\nlikelihood or other measurements from a generative model. Reconstruction-based\nmethods offer an alternative approach, in which a measure of reconstruction\nerror is used to determine if a sample is out-of-distribution. However,\nreconstruction-based approaches are less favoured, as they require careful\ntuning of the model's information bottleneck - such as the size of the latent\ndimension - to produce good results. In this work, we exploit the view of\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) as denoising autoencoders where\nthe bottleneck is controlled externally, by means of the amount of noise\napplied.

The success of\nadversarial attacks raises serious concerns about the robustness of CNNs, and\nprevents them from being used in safety-critical applications, such as medical\ndiagnosis and autonomous driving. Our work introduces a visual analytics\napproach to understanding adversarial attacks by answering two questions: (1)\nwhich neurons are more vulnerable to attacks and (2) which image features do\nthese vulnerable neurons capture during the prediction? For the first question,\nwe introduce multiple perturbation-based measures to break down the attacking\nmagnitude into individual CNN neurons and rank the neurons by their\nvulnerability levels. For the second, we identify image features (e.g., cat\nears) that highly stimulate a user-selected neuron to augment and validate the\nneuron's responsibility. Furthermore, we support an interactive exploration of\na large number of neurons by aiding with hierarchical clustering based on the\nneurons' roles in the prediction.

One\ncomplication in this learning task is that some users are more likely to\npurchase products or review them, and some products are more likely to be\npurchased or reviewed by the users. This non-uniform pattern degrades the power\nof many existing recommendation algorithms, as they assume that the observed\ndata are sampled uniformly at random among user-product pairs. In addition,\nexisting literature on modeling non-uniformity either assume user interests are\nindependent of the products, or lack theoretical understanding. In this paper,\nwe first model the user-product preferences as a partially observed matrix with\nnon-uniform observation pattern. Next, building on the literature about\nlow-rank matrix estimation, we introduce a new weighted trace-norm penalized\nregression to predict unobserved values of the matrix. We then prove an upper\nbound for the prediction error of our proposed approach. Our upper bound is a\nfunction of a number of parameters that are based on a certain weight matrix\nthat depends on the joint distribution of users and products.

However, it is difficult to design components that can be\nused to form symbolic abstractions and which are highly-overparametrized like\nneural networks, as the adjustment of parameters makes the semantics of modules\nunstable.

However,\nvoluminous amounts of data are necessary for deep models to perform\neffectively, which requires exhaustive and quality data collection,\nparticularly of state labels. Consequently, obtaining labelled state data for\nsoft robotic systems is challenged for various reasons, including difficulty in\nthe sensorization of soft robots and the inconvenience of collecting data in\nunstructured environments. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose\na semi-supervised sequential variational Bayes (DSVB) framework for transfer\nlearning and state inference in soft robots with missing state labels on\ncertain robot configurations. Considering that soft robots may exhibit distinct\ndynamics under different robot configurations, a feature space transfer\nstrategy is also incorporated to promote the adaptation of latent features\nacross multiple configurations. Unlike existing transfer learning approaches,\nour proposed DSVB employs a recurrent neural network to model the nonlinear\ndynamics and temporal coherence in soft robot data. The proposed framework is\nvalidated on multiple setup configurations of a pneumatic-based soft robot\nfinger. Experimental results on four transfer scenarios demonstrate that DSVB\nperforms effective transfer learning and accurate state inference amidst\nmissing state labels.\n","authors":["Shageenderan Sapai","Junn Yong Loo","Ze Yang Ding","Chee Pin Tan","Raphael CW Phan","Vishnu Monn Baskaran","Surya Girinatha Nurzaman"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01693v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation\n  (ICRA) 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08672v2","updated":"2023-03-06T17:22:50Z","published":"2022-08-18T07:11:34Z","title":"RRWaveNet: A Compact End-to-End Multi-Scale Residual CNN for Robust PPG\n  Respiratory Rate Estimation","summary":"  Respiratory rate (RR) is an important biomarker as RR changes can reflect\nsevere medical events such as heart disease, lung disease, and sleep disorders.\nUnfortunately, standard manual RR counting is prone to human error and cannot\nbe performed continuously.

One line of work generalizes the notion of\nprotected subgroups beyond simple discrete classes by introducing the notion of\na \"rich subgroup\", and seeks to train models that are calibrated or equalize\nerror rates with respect to these richer subgroup classes. Largely\northogonally, local model explanation methods have been developed that given a\nclassifier h and test point x, attribute influence for the prediction h(x) to\nthe individual features of x.

If the model places high weight on a given feature in a specific\nprotected subgroup, but not on the dataset overall (or vice versa), this could\nbe a potential indicator of bias in the predictive model or the underlying data\ngenerating process, and is at the very least a useful diagnostic that signals\nthe need for a domain expert to delve deeper.

However, while efficient algorithms\nare known for convex potentials $V$, the situation is much more difficult in\nthe non-convex case, where algorithms necessarily suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality in the worst case. For optimization, which can be seen as a\nlow-temperature limit of sampling, it is known that smooth functions $V$ allow\nfaster convergence rates. Specifically, for $m$-times differentiable functions\nin $d$ dimensions, the optimal rate for algorithms with $n$ function\nevaluations is known to be $O(n^{-m/d})$, where the constant can potentially\ndepend on $m, d$ and the function to be optimized. Hence, the curse of\ndimensionality can be alleviated for smooth functions at least in terms of the\nconvergence rate. Recently, it has been shown that similarly fast rates can\nalso be achieved with polynomial runtime $O(n^{3.5})$, where the exponent $3.5$\nis independent of $m$ or $d$. Hence, it is natural to ask whether similar rates\nfor sampling and log-partition computation are possible, and whether they can\nbe realized in polynomial time with an exponent independent of $m$ and $d$.

A method that uses metaheuristic algorithms is attracting attention\nin research on hyperparameter optimization. Metaheuristic algorithms are\nnaturally inspired and include evolution strategies, genetic algorithms,\nantcolony optimization and particle swarm optimization. In particular, particle\nswarm optimization converges faster than genetic algorithms, and various models\nhave been proposed. In this paper, we pro-pose CNN hyperparameter optimization\nwith linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization (LDWPSO). In the\nexperiment, the MNIST data set and CIFAR-10 data set, which are often used as\nbenchmark data sets, are used. By opti-mizing CNN hyperparameters with LDWPSO,\nlearning the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we compare the accuracy with a\nstandard CNN based on LeNet-5. As a result, when using the MNIST dataset, the\nbaseline CNN is 94.02% at the 5th epoch, compared to 98.95% for LDWPSO CNN,\nwhich improves accuracy. When using the CIFAR-10 dataset, the Baseline CNN is\n28.07% at the 10th epoch, compared to 69.37% for the LDWPSO CNN, which greatly\nimproves accuracy.

To be specific,\nwe consider representations learned by contrastive methods as the true\nunderlying latent variable. This contrastive latent variable could guide EBMs\nto understand the data structure better, so it can improve and accelerate EBM\ntraining significantly. To enable the joint training of EBM and CRL, we also\ndesign a new class of latent-variable EBMs for learning the joint density of\ndata and the contrastive latent variable. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat our scheme achieves lower FID scores, compared to prior-art EBM methods\n(e.g., additionally using variational autoencoders or diffusion techniques),\neven with significantly faster and more memory-efficient training. We also show\nconditional and compositional generation abilities of our latent-variable EBMs\nas their additional benefits, even without explicit conditional training.

The impact of DL-based denoising was evaluated using fidelity-based\nFoMs and AUC, which quantified performance on detecting perfusion defects in\nMPS images as obtained using a model observer with anthropomorphic channels.\nBased on fidelity-based FoMs, denoising using the considered DL-based method\nled to significantly superior performance. However, based on ROC analysis,\ndenoising did not improve, and in fact, often degraded detection-task\nperformance. The results motivate the need for objective task-based evaluation\nof DL-based denoising approaches. Further, this study shows how VCTs provide a\nmechanism to conduct such evaluations using VCTs. Finally, our theoretical\ntreatment reveals insights into the reasons for the limited performance of the\ndenoising approach.\n","authors":["Zitong Yu","Md Ashequr Rahman","Richard Laforest","Thomas H.

The success of\nadversarial attacks raises serious concerns about the robustness of CNNs, and\nprevents them from being used in safety-critical applications, such as medical\ndiagnosis and autonomous driving. Our work introduces a visual analytics\napproach to understanding adversarial attacks by answering two questions: (1)\nwhich neurons are more vulnerable to attacks and (2) which image features do\nthese vulnerable neurons capture during the prediction? For the first question,\nwe introduce multiple perturbation-based measures to break down the attacking\nmagnitude into individual CNN neurons and rank the neurons by their\nvulnerability levels.

CRFSEG improves upon the Faster\nR-CNN algorithm with arbitrarily angled bounding boxes that allow the CRFSEG to\nperform better in challenging slap images. After training the CRFSEG algorithm\non a new dataset containing slap images collected from both adult and children\nsubjects, our results suggest that the CRFSEG model was invariant across\ndifferent age groups and can handle over-rotated slap images successfully. In\nthe Combined dataset containing both normal and rotated images of adult and\nchildren subjects, we achieved a matching accuracy of 97.17%, which\noutperformed state-of-the-art VeriFinger (94.25%) and NFSEG segmentation\nsystems (80.58%).\n","authors":["M.

This\nmetaheuristic allows an important reduction of the optimization runtime\nobtaining good results in a low number of generations. Besides, this reduction\nis also increased due to the efficient storage of evaluated caches.

Specifically, when training on backdoored examples, CLIP\nlearns spurious correlations between the embedded backdoor trigger and the\ntarget label, aligning their representations in the joint embedding space. With\ninjecting only a few poisoned examples e.g., 75 examples in the 3M pretraining\ndata, the model's behavior can be significantly manipulated, thus making it\nhard to detect or unlearn such correlations. To address this issue, we propose\nCleanCLIP, a finetuning framework that weakens the learned spurious\nassociations introduced by backdoor attacks by re-aligning the representations\nfor individual modalities independently. CleanCLIP can be employed for both\nunsupervised finetuning on paired image-text data and for supervised finetuning\non labeled image data.

In this work, we address\nthese challenges by introducing TalkToModel: an interactive dialogue system for\nexplaining machine learning models through conversations. Specifically,\nTalkToModel comprises of three key components: 1) a natural language interface\nfor engaging in conversations, making ML model explainability highly\naccessible, 2) a dialogue engine that adapts to any tabular model and dataset,\ninterprets natural language, maps it to appropriate explanations, and generates\ntext responses, and 3) an execution component that constructs the explanations.\nWe carried out extensive quantitative and human subject evaluations of\nTalkToModel. Overall, we found the conversational system understands user\ninputs on novel datasets and models with high accuracy, demonstrating the\nsystem's capacity to generalize to new situations. In real-world evaluations\nwith humans, 73% of healthcare workers (e.g., doctors and nurses) agreed they\nwould use TalkToModel over baseline point-and-click systems for explainability\nin a disease prediction task, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel\nwas easier to use for computing explanations.

Any automaton can serve as a component; using specific\ncomponents allows for a fine-grained control of the expressivity of the\nresulting class of automata; using prime automata as components implies\nspecific expressivity guarantees. Moreover, specifying automata as cascades\nallows for describing the sample complexity of automata in terms of their\ncomponents.

This opens to the possibility of learning automata representing large\ndynamical systems consisting of many parts interacting with each other.

In most MARL studies, agents in a game are\ndefined as teammates or enemies beforehand, and the relationships among the\nagents remain fixed throughout the game. However, in real-world problems, the\nagent relationships are commonly unknown in advance or dynamically changing.\nMany multi-party interactions start off by asking: who is on my team? This\nquestion arises whether it is the first day at the stock exchange or the\nkindergarten. Therefore, training policies for such situations in the face of\nimperfect information and ambiguous identities is an important problem that\nneeds to be addressed. In this work, we develop a novel identity detection\nreinforcement learning (IDRL) framework that allows an agent to dynamically\ninfer the identities of nearby agents and select an appropriate policy to\naccomplish the task. In the IDRL framework, a relation network is constructed\nto deduce the identities of other agents by observing the behaviors of the\nagents. A danger network is optimized to estimate the risk of false-positive\nidentifications. Beyond that, we propose an intrinsic reward that balances the\nneed to maximize external rewards and accurate identification. After\nidentifying the cooperation-competition pattern among the agents, IDRL applies\none of the off-the-shelf MARL methods to learn the policy. To evaluate the\nproposed method, we conduct experiments on Red-10 card-shedding game, and the\nresults show that IDRL achieves superior performance over other\nstate-of-the-art MARL methods. Impressively, the relation network has the par\nperformance to identify the identities of agents with top human players; the\ndanger network reasonably avoids the risk of imperfect identification.

Their adaptation to\nzero-shot image-conditioned text generation tasks has drawn increasing\ninterest. Prior arts approach to zero-shot captioning by either utilizing the\nexisting large language models (e.g., GPT-2) or pre-training the\nencoder-decoder network in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we propose a\nsimple framework, named DeCap, for zero-shot captioning. We introduce a\nlightweight visual-aware language decoder. This decoder is both data-efficient\nand computation-efficient: 1) it only requires the text data for training,\neasing the burden on the collection of paired data. 2) it does not require\nend-to-end training. When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the\ntext embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix\nembedding. The challenge is that the decoder is trained on the text corpus but\nat the inference stage, it needs to generate captions based on visual inputs.\nThe modality gap issue is widely observed in multi-modal contrastive models\nthat prevents us from directly taking the visual embedding as the prefix\nembedding. We propose a training-free mechanism to reduce the modality gap. We\nproject the visual embedding into the CLIP text embedding space, while the\nprojected embedding retains the information of the visual input. Taking the\nprojected embedding as the prefix embedding, the decoder generates high-quality\ndescriptions that match the visual input. The experiments show that DeCap\noutperforms other zero-shot captioning methods and unpaired captioning methods\non the typical image captioning benchmarks, i.e., MSCOCO and NoCaps.\n","authors":["Wei Li","Linchao Zhu","Longyin Wen","Yi Yang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03032v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted by ICLR 2023.

We propose an augmentation-free graph contrastive\nlearning method, invariant-discriminative graph contrastive learning (iGCL),\nthat does not intrinsically require negative samples. iGCL designs the\ninvariant-discriminative loss (ID loss) to learn invariant and discriminative\nrepresentations. On the one hand, ID loss learns invariant signals by directly\nminimizing the mean square error between the target samples and positive\nsamples in the representation space. On the other hand, ID loss ensures that\nthe representations are discriminative by an orthonormal constraint forcing the\ndifferent dimensions of representations to be independent of each other. This\nprevents representations from collapsing to a point or subspace.

Due to the complexity\nof the problem, practical problem instances can be solved only via heuristics,\nwhich trade-off solution quality for computational tractability. Among the\nvarious heuristics, a common strategy is problem decomposition, that is, the\nreduction of a large-scale problem into a collection of smaller sub-problems,\nwith spatial and temporal decompositions being two natural approaches. While\nspatial decomposition has been successful in certain settings, effective\ntemporal decomposition has been challenging due to the difficulty of stitching\ntogether the sub-problem solutions across the decomposition boundaries. In this\nwork, we introduce a novel temporal decomposition scheme for solving a class of\nPDPTWs that have narrow time windows, for which it is able to provide both fast\nand high-quality solutions.

How can we visualize the\ninternal modeling of multimodal interactions in these models? Our paper aims to\nfill this gap by proposing MultiViz, a method for analyzing the behavior of\nmultimodal models by scaffolding the problem of interpretability into 4 stages:\n(1) unimodal importance: how each modality contributes towards downstream\nmodeling and prediction, (2) cross-modal interactions: how different modalities\nrelate with each other, (3) multimodal representations: how unimodal and\ncross-modal interactions are represented in decision-level features, and (4)\nmultimodal prediction: how decision-level features are composed to make a\nprediction. MultiViz is designed to operate on diverse modalities, models,\ntasks, and research areas. Through experiments on 8 trained models across 6\nreal-world tasks, we show that the complementary stages in MultiViz together\nenable users to (1) simulate model predictions, (2) assign interpretable\nconcepts to features, (3) perform error analysis on model misclassifications,\nand (4) use insights from error analysis to debug models.

At low ratios, blurriness is observed and as compression increases\nblocking artifacts occur. Generally, in order to reduce blockiness, images are\nlow-pass filtered which leads to more blurriness. Also, in bokeh mode images\nthey are commonly seen: blurriness as a result of intentional blurred\nbackground while blocking artifact and global blurriness arising due to\ncompression. Therefore, such visual media suffer from both blockiness and\nblurriness distortions. Along with this, noise is also commonly encountered\ndistortion. Most of the existing works on quality assessment quantify these\ndistortions individually. This paper proposes a methodology to blindly measure\noverall quality of an image suffering from these distortions, individually as\nwell as jointly. This is achieved by considering the sum of absolute values of\nlow and high-frequency Discrete Frequency Transform (DFT) coefficients defined\nas sum magnitudes. The number of blocks lying in specific ranges of sum\nmagnitudes including zero-valued AC coefficients and mean of 100 maximum and\n100 minimum values of these sum magnitudes are used as feature vectors. These\nfeatures are then fed to the Machine Learning (ML) based Gaussian Process\nRegression (GPR) model, which quantifies the image quality.

Unlike scene coordinate\nregression and absolute pose regression methods, which learn absolute scene\nparameters, RPRs can (theoretically) localize in unseen environments, since\nthey only learn the residual pose between camera pairs. In practice, however,\nthe performance of RPRs is significantly degraded in unseen scenes. In this\nwork, we propose to aggregate paired feature maps into latent codes, instead of\noperating on global image descriptors, in order to improve the generalization\nof RPRs. We implement aggregation with concatenation, projection, and attention\noperations (Transformer Encoders) and learn to regress the relative pose\nparameters from the resulting latent codes.

Due to the great difficulty of collecting paired real image\nand 3D hair data, using synthetic data to provide prior knowledge for real\ndomain becomes a leading solution. This unfortunately introduces the challenge\nof domain gap. Due to the inherent difficulty of realistic hair rendering,\nexisting methods typically use orientation maps instead of hair images as input\nto bridge the gap. We firmly think an intermediate representation is essential,\nbut we argue that orientation map using the dominant filtering-based methods is\nsensitive to uncertain noise and far from a competent representation. Thus, we\nfirst raise this issue up and propose a novel intermediate representation,\ntermed as HairStep, which consists of a strand map and a depth map. It is found\nthat HairStep not only provides sufficient information for accurate 3D hair\nmodeling, but also is feasible to be inferred from real images.

On the\npositive side, the detection in a certain frame of a video, compared with that\nin a still image, can draw support from other frames. Hence, how to aggregate\nfeatures across different frames is pivotal to VID problem. Most of existing\naggregation algorithms are customized for two-stage detectors. However, these\ndetectors are usually computationally expensive due to their two-stage nature.\nThis work proposes a simple yet effective strategy to address the above\nconcerns, which costs marginal overheads with significant gains in accuracy.\nConcretely, different from traditional two-stage pipeline, we select important\nregions after the one-stage detection to avoid processing massive low-quality\ncandidates. Besides, we evaluate the relationship between a target frame and\nreference frames to guide the aggregation. We conduct extensive experiments and\nablation studies to verify the efficacy of our design, and reveal its\nsuperiority over other state-of-the-art VID approaches in both effectiveness\nand efficiency.

Previous\nworks usually resort to iterative search methods on the training set, which\nconsume hundreds or even thousands of GPU-hours. In this study, we reveal that\nsome unique learnable parameters in quantization, namely the scale factors in\nthe quantizer, can serve as importance indicators of a layer, reflecting the\ncontribution of that layer to the final accuracy at certain bit-widths. These\nimportance indicators naturally perceive the numerical transformation during\nquantization-aware training, which can precisely provide quantization\nsensitivity metrics of layers. However, a deep network always contains hundreds\nof such indicators, and training them one by one would lead to an excessive\ntime cost. To overcome this issue, we propose a joint training scheme that can\nobtain all indicators at once. It considerably speeds up the indicators\ntraining process by parallelizing the original sequential training processes.\nWith these learned importance indicators, we formulate the MPQ search problem\nas a one-time integer linear programming (ILP) problem. That avoids the\niterative search and significantly reduces search time without limiting the\nbit-width search space. For example, MPQ search on ResNet18 with our indicators\ntakes only 0.06 s, which improves time efficiency exponentially compared to\niterative search methods.

ML models perform exceedingly well when test examples are similar\nto train examples. However, real-world applications are required to perform on\nany distribution of test examples. Current ML systems can fail silently on test\nexamples with distribution shifts. In order to improve reliability of ML models\ndue to covariate or domain shift, we propose algorithms that enable models to:\n(a) generalize to a larger family of test distributions, (b) evaluate accuracy\nunder distribution shifts, (c) adapt to a target distribution. We study causes\nof impaired robustness to domain shifts and present algorithms for training\ndomain robust models. A key source of model brittleness is due to domain\noverfitting, which our new training algorithms suppress and instead encourage\ndomain-general hypotheses. While we improve robustness over standard training\nmethods for certain problem settings, performance of ML systems can still vary\ndrastically with domain shifts. It is crucial for developers and stakeholders\nto understand model vulnerabilities and operational ranges of input, which\ncould be assessed on the fly during the deployment, albeit at a great cost.\nInstead, we advocate for proactively estimating accuracy surfaces over any\ncombination of prespecified and interpretable domain shifts for performance\nforecasting. We present a label-efficient estimation to address estimation over\na combinatorial space of domain shifts. Further, when a model's performance on\na target domain is found to be poor, traditional approaches adapt the model\nusing the target domain's resources. Standard adaptation methods assume access\nto sufficient labeled resources, which may be impractical for deployed models.\nWe initiate a study of lightweight adaptation techniques with only unlabeled\ndata resources with a focus on language applications.\n","authors":["Vihari Piratla"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02781v1.pdf","comment":"PhD Thesis; 191 pages; Dept of Computer Science, IIT Bombay"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03375v2","updated":"2023-03-05T21:26:23Z","published":"2021-10-07T12:13:19Z","title":"Learning Pessimism for Robust and Efficient Off-Policy Reinforcement\n  Learning","summary":"  Off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithms commonly compensate for\noverestimation bias during temporal-difference learning by utilizing\npessimistic estimates of the expected target returns.

At low ratios, blurriness is observed and as compression increases\nblocking artifacts occur. Generally, in order to reduce blockiness, images are\nlow-pass filtered which leads to more blurriness. Also, in bokeh mode images\nthey are commonly seen: blurriness as a result of intentional blurred\nbackground while blocking artifact and global blurriness arising due to\ncompression. Therefore, such visual media suffer from both blockiness and\nblurriness distortions. Along with this, noise is also commonly encountered\ndistortion. Most of the existing works on quality assessment quantify these\ndistortions individually. This paper proposes a methodology to blindly measure\noverall quality of an image suffering from these distortions, individually as\nwell as jointly. This is achieved by considering the sum of absolute values of\nlow and high-frequency Discrete Frequency Transform (DFT) coefficients defined\nas sum magnitudes. The number of blocks lying in specific ranges of sum\nmagnitudes including zero-valued AC coefficients and mean of 100 maximum and\n100 minimum values of these sum magnitudes are used as feature vectors. These\nfeatures are then fed to the Machine Learning (ML) based Gaussian Process\nRegression (GPR) model, which quantifies the image quality. The simulation\nresults show that the proposed method can estimate the quality of images\ndistorted with the blockiness, blurriness, noise and their combinations. It is\nrelatively fast compared to many state-of-art methods, and therefore is\nsuitable for real-time quality monitoring applications.\n","authors":["Maryam Viqar","Athar A.

By integrating XAutoML with JupyterLab,\nexperienced users can extend the visual analytics with ad-hoc visualizations\nbased on information extracted from XAutoML. We validate our approach in a user\nstudy with the same diverse user group from the requirements analysis.

Also, MTSVD is the first\npublicly available missing object dataset. To train the models for identifying\nmissing signs, we complement our dataset with 10K traffic sign tracks, with 40\npercent of the traffic signs having cues visible in the scenes. For identifying\nmissing signs, we propose the Cue-driven Contextual Attention units (CueCAn),\nwhich we incorporate in our model encoder.

Deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach to adaptively control\ntraffic lights based on the real-time traffic situation in a road network.\nHowever, conventional methods may suffer from poor scalability. In this paper,\nwe investigate deep reinforcement learning to control traffic lights, and both\ntheoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that the intelligent\nbehavior ``greenwave\" (i.e., a vehicle will see a progressive cascade of green\nlights, and not have to brake at any intersection) emerges naturally a grid\nroad network, which is proved to be the optimal policy in an avenue with\nmultiple cross streets. As a first step, we use two DRL algorithms for the\ntraffic light control problems in two scenarios. In a single road intersection,\nwe verify that the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm delivers a thresholding\npolicy; and in a grid road network, we adopt the deep deterministic policy\ngradient (DDPG) algorithm. Secondly, numerical experiments show that the DQN\nalgorithm delivers the optimal control, and the DDPG algorithm with passive\nobservations has the capability to produce on its own a high-level intelligent\nbehavior in a grid road network, namely, the ``greenwave\" policy emerges. We\nalso verify the ``greenwave\" patterns in a $5 \\times 10$ grid road network.\nThirdly, the ``greenwave\" patterns demonstrate that DRL algorithms produce\nfavorable solutions since the ``greenwave\" policy shown in experiment results\nis proved to be optimal in a specified traffic model (an avenue with multiple\ncross streets). The delivered policies both in a single road intersection and a\ngrid road network demonstrate the scalability of DRL algorithms.\n","authors":["Xiao-Yang Liu","Ming Zhu","Sem Borst","Anwar Walid"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.03669v2.pdf","comment":"17 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05907v3","updated":"2023-03-05T07:58:44Z","published":"2023-02-12T13:10:57Z","title":"LipLearner: Customizable Silent Speech Interactions on Mobile Devices","summary":"  Silent speech interface is a promising technology that enables private\ncommunications in natural language.

In recent years, the quantum resource\ntheory (QRT) has been established to characterize various quantum resources,\nyet their roles in quantum computing tasks still require investigation. The\nso-called universal quantum computing model (UQCM), e.g., the circuit model,\nhas been the main framework to guide the design of quantum algorithms, creation\nof real quantum computers etc. In this work, we combine the study of UQCM\ntogether with QRT. We find on one hand, using QRT can provide a\nresource-theoretic characterization of a UQCM, the relation among models and\ninspire new ones, and on the other hand, using UQCM offers a framework to apply\nresources, study relation among resources and classify them.\n  We develop the theory of universal resources in the setting of UQCM, and find\na rich spectrum of UQCMs and the corresponding universal resources. Depending\non a hierarchical structure of resource theories, we find models can be\nclassified into families. In this work, we study three natural families of\nUQCMs in details: the amplitude family, the quasi-probability family, and the\nHamiltonian family. They include some well known models, like the\nmeasurement-based model and adiabatic model, and also inspire new models such\nas the contextual model we introduce. Each family contains at least a triplet\nof models, and such a succinct structure of families of UQCMs offers a unifying\npicture to investigate resources and design models.

As a result, many individuals have become interested in\nrelated resources and are seeking to uncover the background and secrets behind\nits impressive performance. In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI)\ntechniques belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content\n(AIGC), which involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music,\nand natural language, through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the\ncontent creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the\nproduction of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by\nextracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by\nhuman, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent\ninformation. In recent years, large-scale models have become increasingly\nimportant in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus, improved\ngeneration results. With the growth of data and the size of the models, the\ndistribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer to\nreality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This\nsurvey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and\nbasic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and\nmultimodal interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the\ngeneration tasks and relative models of text and image.

Compared to previous works in multimodal\nTransformers, the key challenge here is to use the attested flexibility of ViTs\nto capture cross-modal interactions at the downstream and not the pretraining\nstage. We explore which depth representation is better in terms of resulting\naccuracy and compare early and late fusion techniques for aligning the RGB and\ndepth modalities within the ViT architecture. Experimental results in the\nWashington RGB-D Objects dataset (ROD) demonstrate that in such RGB -> RGB-D\nscenarios, late fusion techniques work better than most popularly employed\nearly fusion. With our transfer baseline, fusion ViTs score up to 95.4% top-1\naccuracy in ROD, achieving new state-of-the-art results in this benchmark. We\nfurther show the benefits of using our multimodal fusion baseline over unimodal\nfeature extractors in a synthetic-to-real visual adaptation as well as in an\nopen-ended lifelong learning scenario in the ROD benchmark, where our model\noutperforms previous works by a margin of >8%.

We\ntackle the main drawback of reflected light images, that is, the low contrast\nattenuation of lines and intensity jumps due to noise and degradation, by\nemploying the spectral total variation decomposition and develop methods for\nsubsequent line extraction. Our results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of\nusing reflected light images in paper analysis. This work enables the feature\nextraction for paper manuscripts that have otherwise not been analysed due to a\nlack of appropriate images.

The challenges are twofold: 1) the current methods still\nleave considerable room for improvement in terms of visual quality even on the\nsynthetic dataset, and 2) poor generalization to real-world data. To this end,\nwe propose a blur interpolation transformer (BiT) to effectively unravel the\nunderlying temporal correlation encoded in blur.

Hybrid quantum-classical convolutional and\nresidual neural networks are developed based on the classical architectures.\nThese models make a proper balance between the limited function of the current\nquantum devices and the large size of phytoplankton images, which make it\npossible to perform phytoplankton classification on the near-term quantum\ncomputers. Better performance is obtained by the quantum-enhanced models\nagainst the classical counterparts. In particular, quantum models converge much\nfaster than classical ones. The present quantum models are versatile, and can\nbe applied for various tasks of image classification in the field of marine\nscience.\n","authors":["Shangshang Shi","Zhimin Wang","Ruimin Shang","Yanan Li","Jiaxin Li","Guoqiang Zhong","Yongjian Gu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03707v1.pdf","comment":"20 pages, 13 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03698v1","updated":"2023-03-07T07:30:08Z","published":"2023-03-07T07:30:08Z","title":"FIT: Frequency-based Image Translation for Domain Adaptive Object\n  Detection","summary":"  Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) aims to adapt the detector from a\nlabelled source domain to an unlabelled target domain.

However, it still remains\nchallenging to craft targeted adversarial examples with higher transferability\nthan non-targeted ones. Recent studies reveal that the traditional\nCross-Entropy (CE) loss function is insufficient to learn transferable targeted\nadversarial examples due to the issue of vanishing gradient. In this work, we\nprovide a comprehensive investigation of the CE loss function and find that the\nlogit margin between the targeted and untargeted classes will quickly obtain\nsaturation in CE, which largely limits the transferability. Therefore, in this\npaper, we devote to the goal of continually increasing the logit margin along\nthe optimization to deal with the saturation issue and propose two simple and\neffective logit calibration methods, which are achieved by downscaling the\nlogits with a temperature factor and an adaptive margin, respectively.

It is thus important to propose\neffective fingerprint presentation attack detection (PAD) methods for the\nsafety and reliability of AFRSs. However, current PAD methods often exhibit\npoor robustness under new attack types settings. This paper thus proposes a\nnovel channel-wise feature denoising fingerprint PAD (CFD-PAD) method by\nhandling the redundant noise information ignored in previous studies. The\nproposed method learns important features of fingerprint images by weighing the\nimportance of each channel and identifying discriminative channels and \"noise\"\nchannels. Then, the propagation of \"noise\" channels is suppressed in the\nfeature map to reduce interference. Specifically, a PA-Adaptation loss is\ndesigned to constrain the feature distribution to make the feature distribution\nof live fingerprints more aggregate and that of spoof fingerprints more\ndisperse. Experimental results evaluated on the LivDet 2017 dataset showed that\nthe proposed CFD-PAD can achieve a 2.53% average classification error (ACE) and\na 93.83% true detection rate when the false detection rate equals 1.0%\n(TDR@FDR=1%).

However, generating BEVs from\nsurround-view fisheye camera images is challenging due to the strong\ndistortions introduced by such wide-angle lenses. We take the first step in\naddressing this challenge and introduce a baseline, F2BEV, to generate BEV\nheight maps and semantic segmentation maps from fisheye images. F2BEV consists\nof a distortion-aware spatial cross attention module for querying and\nconsolidating spatial information from fisheye image features in a\ntransformer-style architecture followed by a task-specific head.

However, most existing methods are still\nchallenged by heavy compute cost and biased filter selection. Moreover, most\ndesigns for filter evaluation miss interpretability due to the lack of\nappropriate theoretical guidance. In this paper, we propose a novel filter\npruning method which evaluates filters in a interpretable, multi-persepective\nand data-free manner. We introduce information capacity, a metric that\nrepresents the amount of information contained in a filter. Based on the\ninterpretability and validity of information entropy, we propose to use that as\na quantitative index of information quantity. Besides, we experimently show\nthat the obvious correlation between the entropy of the feature map and the\ncorresponding filter, so as to propose an interpretable, data-driven scheme to\nmeasure the information capacity of the filter. Further, we introduce\ninformation independence, another metric that represents the correlation among\ndifferrent filters. Consequently, the least impotant filters, which have less\ninformation capacity and less information independence, will be pruned. We\nevaluate our method on two benchmarks using multiple representative CNN\narchitectures, including VGG-16 and ResNet. On CIFAR-10, we reduce 71.9% of\nfloating-point operations (FLOPs) and 69.4% of parameters for ResNet-110 with\n0.28% accuracy increase.

In particular, we conduct researches on\nthree core questions: First, what to drop in self-attention layers? Different\nfrom dropping attention weights in literature, we propose to move dropout\noperations forward ahead of attention matrix calculation and set the Key as the\ndropout unit, yielding a novel dropout-before-softmax scheme. We theoretically\nverify that this scheme helps keep both regularization and probability features\nof attention weights, alleviating the overfittings problem to specific patterns\nand enhancing the model to globally capture vital information; Second, how to\nschedule the drop ratio in consecutive layers? In contrast to exploit a\nconstant drop ratio for all layers, we present a new decreasing schedule that\ngradually decreases the drop ratio along the stack of self-attention layers. We\nexperimentally validate the proposed schedule can avoid overfittings in\nlow-level features and missing in high-level semantics, thus improving the\nrobustness and stableness of model training; Third, whether need to perform\nstructured dropout operation as CNN? We attempt patch-based block-version of\ndropout operation and find that this useful trick for CNN is not essential for\nViT. Given exploration on the above three questions, we present the novel\nDropKey method that regards Key as the drop unit and exploits decreasing\nschedule for drop ratio, improving ViTs in a general way. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DropKey for various ViT\narchitectures, e.g. T2T and VOLO, as well as for various vision tasks, e.g.,\nimage classification, object detection, human-object interaction detection and\nhuman body shape recovery.

It first disentangles\nthe content and style of source and target images into identifiers, which are\nthen recombined in a cross manner to derive the stylized face image. In this\nway, StyO decomposes complex images into independent and specific attributes,\nand simplifies one-shot face stylization as the combination of different\nattributes from input images, thus producing results better matching face\ngeometry of target image and content of source one. StyO is implemented with\nlatent diffusion models (LDM) and composed of two key modules: 1) Identifier\nDisentanglement Learner (IDL) for disentanglement phase.

Our approach builds on\nexisting works on differentiable point-based rendering but introduces a novel\ntechnique we call \"Sculpted Neural Points (SNP)\", which significantly improves\nthe robustness to errors and holes in the reconstructed point cloud. We further\npropose to use view-dependent point features based on spherical harmonics to\ncapture non-Lambertian surfaces, and new designs in the point-based rendering\npipeline that further boost the performance.

Recent advanced multi-modal methods mainly perform global fusion,\nwhere image features and point cloud features are fused across the whole scene.\nSuch practice lacks fine-grained region-level information, yielding suboptimal\nfusion performance. In this paper, we present the novel Local-to-Global fusion\nnetwork (LoGoNet), which performs LiDAR-camera fusion at both local and global\nlevels. Concretely, the Global Fusion (GoF) of LoGoNet is built upon previous\nliterature, while we exclusively use point centroids to more precisely\nrepresent the position of voxel features, thus achieving better cross-modal\nalignment. As to the Local Fusion (LoF), we first divide each proposal into\nuniform grids and then project these grid centers to the images. The image\nfeatures around the projected grid points are sampled to be fused with\nposition-decorated point cloud features, maximally utilizing the rich\ncontextual information around the proposals. The Feature Dynamic Aggregation\n(FDA) module is further proposed to achieve information interaction between\nthese locally and globally fused features, thus producing more informative\nmulti-modal features. Extensive experiments on both Waymo Open Dataset (WOD)\nand KITTI datasets show that LoGoNet outperforms all state-of-the-art 3D\ndetection methods.

In this context, we\nanalyze the nonconvex landscape of the Riemannian optimization problem over the\nproduct of spheres, showing a benign global landscape in the sense that the\nonly global minimizers are the neural collapse solutions while all other\ncritical points are strict saddles with negative curvature. Experimental\nresults on practical deep networks corroborate our theory and demonstrate that\nbetter representations can be learned faster via feature normalization.\n","authors":["Can Yaras","Peng Wang","Zhihui Zhu","Laura Balzano","Qing Qu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09211v2.pdf","comment":"The first two authors contributed to this work equally; 38 pages, 13\n  figures.

However, travel behavior depends on the factors\nrepresented by both numeric data and urban imagery, thus necessitating a\nsynergetic framework to combine them. This study creates a theoretical\nframework of deep hybrid models with a crossing structure consisting of a\nmixing operator and a behavioral predictor, thus integrating the numeric and\nimagery data into a latent space. Empirically, this framework is applied to\nanalyze travel mode choice using the MyDailyTravel Survey from Chicago as the\nnumeric inputs and the satellite images as the imagery inputs. We found that\ndeep hybrid models outperform both the traditional demand models and the recent\ndeep learning in predicting the aggregate and disaggregate travel behavior with\nour supervision-as-mixing design. The latent space in deep hybrid models can be\ninterpreted, because it reveals meaningful spatial and social patterns. The\ndeep hybrid models can also generate new urban images that do not exist in\nreality and interpret them with economic theory, such as computing substitution\npatterns and social welfare changes. Overall, the deep hybrid models\ndemonstrate the complementarity between the low-dimensional numeric and\nhigh-dimensional imagery data and between the traditional demand modeling and\nrecent deep learning. It generalizes the latent classes and variables in\nclassical hybrid demand models to a latent space, and leverages the\ncomputational power of deep learning for imagery while retaining the economic\ninterpretability on the microeconomics foundation.\n","authors":["Qingyi Wang","Shenhao Wang","Yunhan Zheng","Hongzhou Lin","Xiaohu Zhang","Jinhua Zhao","Joan Walker"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04204v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04203v1","updated":"2023-03-07T19:47:01Z","published":"2023-03-07T19:47:01Z","title":"Toward a Geometric Theory of Manifold Untangling","summary":"  It has been hypothesized that the ventral stream processing for object\nrecognition is based on a mechanism called cortically local subspace\nuntangling.

The automatic generation of such co-speech\ngestures is a long-standing problem in computer animation and is considered an\nenabling technology in film, games, virtual social spaces, and for interaction\nwith social robots. The problem is made challenging by the idiosyncratic and\nnon-periodic nature of human co-speech gesture motion, and by the great\ndiversity of communicative functions that gestures encompass. Gesture\ngeneration has seen surging interest recently, owing to the emergence of more\nand larger datasets of human gesture motion, combined with strides in\ndeep-learning-based generative models, that benefit from the growing\navailability of data. This review article summarizes co-speech gesture\ngeneration research, with a particular focus on deep generative models. First,\nwe articulate the theory describing human gesticulation and how it complements\nspeech. Next, we briefly discuss rule-based and classical statistical gesture\nsynthesis, before delving into deep learning approaches. We employ the choice\nof input modalities as an organizing principle, examining systems that generate\ngestures from audio, text, and non-linguistic input.

Finally, we identify key research challenges in\ngesture generation, including data availability and quality; producing\nhuman-like motion; grounding the gesture in the co-occurring speech in\ninteraction with other speakers, and in the environment; performing gesture\nevaluation; and integration of gesture synthesis into applications.

This paper proposes a\nnovel and end-to-end integrated framework for high resolution and attribute\npreservation face swapping via Adaptive Latent Representation Learning.\nSpecifically, we first design a multi-task dual-space face encoder by sharing\nthe underlying feature extraction network to simultaneously complete the facial\nregion perception and face encoding.

Our empirical study, which leverages oracle dynamics\nmodels to avoid compounding model errors, shows that (1) longer horizons\nincrease sample efficiency, but the gain in improvement decreases with each\nadditional expansion step, and (2) the increased model accuracy only marginally\nincreases the sample efficiency compared to learned models with identical\nhorizons. Therefore, longer horizons and increased model accuracy yield\ndiminishing returns in terms of sample efficiency. These improvements in sample\nefficiency are particularly disappointing when compared to model-free value\nexpansion methods. Even though they introduce no computational overhead, we\nfind their performance to be on-par with model-based value expansion methods.\nTherefore, we conclude that the limitation of model-based value expansion\nmethods is not the model accuracy of the learned models. While higher model\naccuracy is beneficial, our experiments show that even a perfect model will not\nprovide an un-rivalled sample efficiency but that the bottleneck lies\nelsewhere.\n","authors":["Daniel Palenicek","Michael Lutter","Joao Carvalho","Jan Peters"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03955v1.pdf","comment":"Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11864v2","updated":"2023-03-07T15:01:39Z","published":"2023-02-23T09:06:42Z","title":"Grounding Graph Network Simulators using Physical Sensor Observations","summary":"  Physical simulations that accurately model reality are crucial for many\nengineering disciplines such as mechanical engineering and robotic motion\nplanning.

Although only the model parameters or\nother model updates are exchanged during the federated training instead of the\nparticipant's data, many attacks have shown that it is still possible to infer\nsensitive information such as membership, property, or outright reconstruction\nof participant data. Although differential privacy is considered an effective\nsolution to protect against privacy attacks, it is also criticized for its\nnegative effect on utility. Another possible defense is to use secure\naggregation which allows the server to only access the aggregated update\ninstead of each individual one, and it is often more appealing because it does\nnot degrade model quality. However, combining only the aggregated updates,\nwhich are generated by a different composition of clients in every round, may\nstill allow the inference of some client-specific information.\n  In this paper, we show that simple linear models can effectively capture\nclient-specific properties only from the aggregated model updates due to the\nlinearity of aggregation.

We do\nso by Masked Augmentation Subspace Training (or MAST) to encode in the single\nfeature space the priors from different data augmentations in a factorized way.\nSpecifically, we disentangle the feature space into separate subspaces, each\ninduced by a learnable mask that selects relevant feature dimensions to model\ninvariance to a specific augmentation. We show the success of MAST in jointly\ncapturing generalizable priors from different augmentations, using both unique\nand shared features across the subspaces. We further show that MAST benefits\nfrom uncertainty modeling to reweight ambiguous samples from strong\naugmentations that may cause similarity mismatch in each subspace. Experiments\ndemonstrate that MAST consistently improves generalization on various\ndownstream tasks, while being task-agnostic and efficient during SSL. We also\nprovide interesting insights about how different augmentations are related and\nhow uncertainty reflects learning difficulty.\n","authors":["Chen Huang","Hanlin Goh","Jiatao Gu","Josh Susskind"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03679v1.pdf","comment":"ICLR 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03678v1","updated":"2023-03-07T06:34:04Z","published":"2023-03-07T06:34:04Z","title":"A Comparative Study of Deep Learning and Iterative Algorithms for Joint\n  Channel Estimation and Signal Detection","summary":"  Joint channel estimation and signal detection (JCESD) is crucial in wireless\ncommunication systems, but traditional algorithms perform poorly in low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios.

In this survey, we present this\nlearning paradigm called Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) which is to\nbuild a model that leverages empirical data and available physical prior\nknowledge to improve performance on a set of tasks that involve a physical\nmechanism. We systematically review the recent development of physics-informed\nmachine learning from three perspectives of machine learning tasks,\nrepresentation of physical prior, and methods for incorporating physical prior.\nWe also propose several important open research problems based on the current\ntrends in the field. We argue that encoding different forms of physical prior\ninto model architectures, optimizers, inference algorithms, and significant\ndomain-specific applications like inverse engineering design and robotic\ncontrol is far from being fully explored in the field of physics-informed\nmachine learning. We believe that the interdisciplinary research of\nphysics-informed machine learning will significantly propel research progress,\nfoster the creation of more effective machine learning models, and also offer\ninvaluable assistance in addressing long-standing problems in related\ndisciplines.\n","authors":["Zhongkai Hao","Songming Liu","Yichi Zhang","Chengyang Ying","Yao Feng","Hang Su","Jun Zhu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08064v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17244v2","updated":"2023-03-07T02:43:20Z","published":"2022-11-30T18:46:00Z","title":"Tight Certification of Adversarially Trained Neural Networks via\n  Nonconvex Low-Rank Semidefinite Relaxations","summary":"  Adversarial training is well-known to produce high-quality neural network\nmodels that are empirically robust against adversarial perturbations.\nNevertheless, once a model has been adversarially trained, one often desires a\ncertification that the model is truly robust against all future attacks.\nUnfortunately, when faced with adversarially trained models, all existing\napproaches have significant trouble making certifications that are strong\nenough to be practically useful.

Moreover, it remains unclear whether\nall negative samples are equally negative. In this work, we present ACTION, an\nAnatomical-aware ConTrastive dIstillatiON framework, for semi-supervised\nmedical image segmentation. Specifically, we first develop an iterative\ncontrastive distillation algorithm by softly labeling the negatives rather than\nbinary supervision between positive and negative pairs.

The most natural and leading strategy is to train a\nquantum machine learning model based on a quantum dataset. Although the\npresence of more training data results in better models, using too much data\nreduces the efficiency of training. In this work, we solve the problem on the\nminimum size of sufficient quantum datasets for learning a unitary\ntransformation exactly, which reveals the power and limitation of quantum data.\nFirst, we prove that the minimum size of a dataset with pure states is $2^n$\nfor learning an $n$-qubit unitary transformation. To fully explore the\ncapability of quantum data, we introduce a practical quantum dataset consisting\nof $n+1$ elementary tensor product states that are sufficient for exact\ntraining.

The main\nlimitation of conventional VLN algorithms is that if an action is mistaken, the\nagent fails to follow the instructions or explores unnecessary regions, leading\nthe agent to an irrecoverable path. To tackle this problem, we propose\nMeta-Explore, a hierarchical navigation method deploying an exploitation policy\nto correct misled recent actions. We show that an exploitation policy, which\nmoves the agent toward a well-chosen local goal among unvisited but observable\nstates, outperforms a method which moves the agent to a previously visited\nstate. We also highlight the demand for imagining regretful explorations with\nsemantically meaningful clues. The key to our approach is understanding the\nobject placements around the agent in spectral-domain. Specifically, we present\na novel visual representation, called scene object spectrum (SOS), which\nperforms category-wise 2D Fourier transform of detected objects. Combining\nexploitation policy and SOS features, the agent can correct its path by\nchoosing a promising local goal. We evaluate our method in three VLN\nbenchmarks: R2R, SOON, and REVERIE. Meta-Explore outperforms other baselines\nand shows significant generalization performance. In addition, local goal\nsearch using the proposed spectral-domain SOS features significantly improves\nthe success rate by 17.1% and SPL by 20.6% for the SOON benchmark.\n","authors":["Minyoung Hwang","Jaeyeon Jeong","Minsoo Kim","Yoonseon Oh","Songhwai Oh"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04077v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted by CVPR 2023.

However, it is unclear how to apply\ndiffusion models to the natural representation of layouts which consists of a\nmix of discrete (class) and continuous (location, size) attributes. To address\nthe conditioning layout generation problem, we introduce DLT, a joint\ndiscrete-continuous diffusion model. DLT is a transformer-based model which has\na flexible conditioning mechanism that allows for conditioning on any given\nsubset of all the layout component classes, locations, and sizes. Our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art generative models on various layout generation\ndatasets with respect to different metrics and conditioning settings.\nAdditionally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed conditioning\nmechanism and the joint continuous-diffusion process. This joint process can be\nincorporated into a wide range of mixed discrete-continuous generative tasks.\n","authors":["Elad Levi","Eli Brosh","Mykola Mykhailych","Meir Perez"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03755v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03751v1","updated":"2023-03-07T09:20:43Z","published":"2023-03-07T09:20:43Z","title":"Zeroth-Order Optimization Meets Human Feedback: Provable Learning via\n  Ranking Oracles","summary":"  In this paper, we focus on a novel optimization problem in which the\nobjective function is a black-box and can only be evaluated through a ranking\noracle.

Specifically, our\nalgorithm employs a new rank-based random estimator for the descent direction\nand is proven to converge to a stationary point. ZO-RankSGD can also be\ndirectly applied to the policy search problem in reinforcement learning when\nonly a ranking oracle of the episode reward is available. This makes ZO-RankSGD\na promising alternative to existing RLHF methods, as it optimizes in an online\nfashion and thus can work without any pre-collected data. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of ZO-RankSGD in a novel application: improving\nthe quality of images generated by a diffusion generative model with human\nranking feedback.

Given the inherent cost and scarcity of in-domain, task-specific\nrobot data, learning from large, diverse, offline human videos has emerged as a\npromising path towards acquiring a generally useful visual representation for\ncontrol; however, how these human videos can be used for general-purpose reward\nlearning remains an open question. We introduce\n$\\textbf{V}$alue-$\\textbf{I}$mplicit $\\textbf{P}$re-training (VIP), a\nself-supervised pre-trained visual representation capable of generating dense\nand smooth reward functions for unseen robotic tasks. VIP casts representation\nlearning from human videos as an offline goal-conditioned reinforcement\nlearning problem and derives a self-supervised dual goal-conditioned\nvalue-function objective that does not depend on actions, enabling pre-training\non unlabeled human videos. Theoretically, VIP can be understood as a novel\nimplicit time contrastive objective that generates a temporally smooth\nembedding, enabling the value function to be implicitly defined via the\nembedding distance, which can then be used to construct the reward for any\ngoal-image specified downstream task. Trained on large-scale Ego4D human videos\nand without any fine-tuning on in-domain, task-specific data, VIP's frozen\nrepresentation can provide dense visual reward for an extensive set of\nsimulated and $\\textbf{real-robot}$ tasks, enabling diverse reward-based visual\ncontrol methods and significantly outperforming all prior pre-trained\nrepresentations.

Existing approaches\ntypically assume a balanced class distribution for both labeled and unlabeled\nmedical images. However, medical image data in reality is commonly imbalanced\n(i.e., multi-class label imbalance), which naturally yields blurry contours and\nusually incorrectly labels rare objects. Moreover, it remains unclear whether\nall negative samples are equally negative. In this work, we present ACTION, an\nAnatomical-aware ConTrastive dIstillatiON framework, for semi-supervised\nmedical image segmentation.

Hence, the key innovation in ACTION is to learn global\nsemantic relationship across the entire dataset and local anatomical features\namong the neighbouring pixels with minimal additional memory footprint. During\nthe training, we introduce anatomical contrast by actively sampling a sparse\nset of hard negative pixels, which can generate smoother segmentation\nboundaries and more accurate predictions.

At runtime,\nthere are often certain actions (a.k.a. treatments) that workers may execute to\nlift the probability that a case ends in a positive outcome. For example, in a\nloan origination process, a possible treatment is to issue multiple loan offers\nto increase the probability that the customer takes a loan. Each treatment has\na cost. Thus, when defining policies for prescribing treatments to cases,\nmanagers need to consider the net gain of the treatments. Also, the effect of a\ntreatment varies over time: treating a case earlier may be more effective than\nlater in a case. This paper presents a prescriptive monitoring method that\nautomates this decision-making task. The method combines causal inference and\nreinforcement learning to learn treatment policies that maximize the net gain.\nThe method leverages a conformal prediction technique to speed up the\nconvergence of the reinforcement learning mechanism by separating cases that\nare likely to end up in a positive or negative outcome, from uncertain cases.\nAn evaluation on two real-life datasets shows that the proposed method\noutperforms a state-of-the-art baseline.\n","authors":["Zahra Dasht Bozorgi","Marlon Dumas","Marcello La Rosa","Artem Polyvyanyy","Mahmoud Shoush","Irene Teinemaa"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03572v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12267v2","updated":"2023-03-07T23:43:30Z","published":"2022-09-25T17:13:24Z","title":"Probabilistic Planning with Partially Ordered Preferences over Temporal\n  Goals","summary":"  In this paper, we study planning in stochastic systems, modeled as Markov\ndecision processes (MDPs), with preferences over temporally extended goals.\nPrior work on temporal planning with preferences assumes that the user\npreferences form a total order, meaning that every pair of outcomes are\ncomparable with each other. In this work, we consider the case where the\npreferences over possible outcomes are a partial order rather than a total\norder.

It brings\ntogether expertise from $\\mathrm{AI}$ and application domains; combines\nmodelling knowledge with engineering know-how; and relies on collaboration\nacross disciplines and between humans and machines. Alongside technical\nadvances, the next wave of progress in the field will come from building a\ncommunity of machine learning researchers, domain experts, citizen scientists,\nand engineers working together to design and deploy effective AI tools. This\nreport summarises the discussions from the seminar and provides a roadmap to\nsuggest how different communities can collaborate to deliver a new wave of\nprogress in AI and its application for scientific discovery.\n","authors":["Philipp Berens","Kyle Cranmer","Neil D.

However, these studies require separate face segmentation and\nblending modules for successful face swapping, and the fixed selection of the\nmanipulated latent code in these works is reckless, thus degrading face\nswapping quality, generalizability, and practicability. This paper proposes a\nnovel and end-to-end integrated framework for high resolution and attribute\npreservation face swapping via Adaptive Latent Representation Learning.\nSpecifically, we first design a multi-task dual-space face encoder by sharing\nthe underlying feature extraction network to simultaneously complete the facial\nregion perception and face encoding. This encoder enables us to control the\nface pose and attribute individually, thus enhancing the face swapping quality.\nNext, we propose an adaptive latent codes swapping module to adaptively learn\nthe mapping between the facial attributes and the latent codes and select\neffective latent codes for improved retention of facial attributes. Finally,\nthe initial face swapping image generated by StyleGAN2 is blended with the\nfacial region mask generated by our encoder to address the background blur\nproblem.

Despite its benefit, we reveal that\ncurrent mainstream works with SR enhancement have not achieved the desired\nrate-distortion trade-off between bitrate saving and quality restoration, due\nto: (1) overemphasizing the enhancement on the decoder side while omitting the\nco-design of encoder, (2) limited generative capacity to recover high-fidelity\nperceptual details, and (3) optimizing the compression-and-restoration pipeline\nfrom the resolution perspective solely, without considering color bit-depth.\nAiming at overcoming these limitations, we are the first to conduct an\nencoder-decoder (i.e., codec) synergy by leveraging the inherent\nvisual-generative property of diffusion models. Specifically, we present the\nCodec-aware Diffusion Modeling (CaDM), a novel NVS paradigm to significantly\nreduce streaming delivery bitrates while holding pretty higher restoration\ncapacity over existing methods. First, CaDM improves the encoder's compression\nefficiency by simultaneously reducing resolution and color bit-depth of video\nframes. Second, CaDM empowers the decoder with high-quality enhancement by\nmaking the denoising diffusion restoration aware of encoder's resolution-color\nconditions. Evaluation on public cloud services with OpenMMLab benchmarks shows\nthat CaDM effectively saves up to 5.12 - 21.44 times bitrates based on common\nvideo standards and achieves much better recovery quality (e.g., FID of 0.61)\nover state-of-the-art neural-enhancing methods.\n","authors":["Qihua Zhou","Ruibin Li","Song Guo","Peiran Dong","Yi Liu","Jingcai Guo","Zhenda Xu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08428v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03202v2","updated":"2023-03-08T14:21:22Z","published":"2023-03-06T15:02:12Z","title":"Continuous Sign Language Recognition with Correlation Network","summary":"  Human body trajectories are a salient cue to identify actions in the video.\nSuch body trajectories are mainly conveyed by hands and face across consecutive\nframes in sign language.

However, due to its limited receptive field, FCN cannot\neffectively capture global context information which is vital for semantic\nsegmentation. As a result, it is beaten by state-of-the-art methods which\nleverage different filter sizes for larger receptive fields. However, such a\nstrategy usually introduces more parameters and increases the computational\ncost. In this paper, we propose a novel global receptive convolution (GRC) to\neffectively increase the receptive field of FCN for context information\nextraction, which results in an improved FCN termed FCN+. The GRC provides\nglobal receptive field for convolution without introducing any extra learnable\nparameters. The motivation of GRC is that different channels of a convolutional\nfilter can have different grid sampling locations across the whole input\nfeature map. Specifically, the GRC first divides the channels of the filter\ninto two groups. The grid sampling locations of the first group are shifted to\ndifferent spatial coordinates across the whole feature map, according to their\nchannel indexes. This can help the convolutional filter capture the global\ncontext information. The grid sampling location of the second group remains\nunchanged to keep the original location information. Convolving using these two\ngroups, the GRC can integrate the global context into the original location\ninformation of each pixel for better dense prediction results.

If the generation of adversarial examples is unregulated,\nimages within reach are no longer secure and pose a threat to non-robust DNNs.\nAlthough gradient obfuscation attempts to address this issue, it has been shown\nto be circumventable. Therefore, we propose a novel adversarial defense\nmechanism, which is referred to as immune defense and is the example-based\npre-defense. This mechanism applies carefully designed quasi-imperceptible\nperturbations to the raw images to prevent the generation of adversarial\nexamples for the raw images, and thereby protecting both images and DNNs. These\nperturbed images are referred to as Immune Examples (IEs). In the white-box\nimmune defense, we provide a gradient-based and an optimization-based approach,\nrespectively. Additionally, the more complex black-box immune defense is taken\ninto consideration. We propose Masked Gradient Sign Descent (MGSD) to reduce\napproximation error and stabilize the update to improve the transferability of\nIEs and thereby ensure their effectiveness against black-box adversarial\nattacks. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimization-based\napproach has superior performance and better visual quality in white-box immune\ndefense.

To\nensure that training is consistent with the equivariance, we propose two\nconcepts for self-supervised tasks: equivariant pretext labels and invariant\ncontrastive loss. Equivariant pretext labels use a set of labels on which we\ncan define the transformations that correspond to the input change. Invariant\ncontrastive loss uses a modified contrastive loss that absorbs the effect of\ntransformations on each input. Experiments on standard image recognition\nbenchmarks demonstrate that the equivariant neural networks exploit the\nproposed equivariant self-supervised tasks.\n","authors":["Yusuke Mukuta","Tatsuya Harada"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04427v1.pdf","comment":"12 pages, 4 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01857v3","updated":"2023-03-08T07:57:17Z","published":"2019-06-05T07:15:17Z","title":"Invariant Feature Coding using Tensor Product Representation","summary":"  In this study, a novel feature coding method that exploits invariance for\ntransformations represented by a finite group of orthogonal matrices is\nproposed.

The intensity of the pandemic on a\ngiven territory is efficiently measured by the reproduction number, quantifying\nthe rate of growth of daily new infections. Recently, estimates for the time\nevolution of the reproduction number were produced using an inverse problem\nformulation with a nonsmooth functional minimization. While it was designed to\nbe robust to the limited quality of the Covid19 data (outliers, missing\ncounts), the procedure lacks the ability to output credibility interval based\nestimates.

After interpretation of the nonsmooth\nfunctional into a Bayesian framework, several sampling schemes are tailored to\nadjust the nonsmooth nature of the resulting posterior distribution.

Specifically, when combined with large language models (LLMs),\nVLMaps can be used to (i) translate natural language commands into a sequence\nof open-vocabulary navigation goals (which, beyond prior work, can be spatial\nby construction, e.g., \"in between the sofa and TV\" or \"three meters to the\nright of the chair\") directly localized in the map, and (ii) can be shared\namong multiple robots with different embodiments to generate new obstacle maps\non-the-fly (by using a list of obstacle categories). Extensive experiments\ncarried out in simulated and real world environments show that VLMaps enable\nnavigation according to more complex language instructions than existing\nmethods.

Various techniques have been proposed to improve performance in\ngoal-conditioned environments, such as automatic curriculum generation and goal\nrelabeling. In this work, we explore a connection between off-policy\nreinforcement learning in goal-conditioned settings and knowledge distillation.\nIn particular: the current Q-value function and the target Q-value estimate are\nboth functions of the goal, and we would like to train the Q-value function to\nmatch its target for all goals. We therefore apply Gradient-Based Attention\nTransfer (Zagoruyko and Komodakis 2017), a knowledge distillation technique, to\nthe Q-function update. We empirically show that this can improve the\nperformance of goal-conditioned off-policy reinforcement learning when the\nspace of goals is high-dimensional.

However, due to\nthe immutability of blockchain, published smart contracts cannot be modified,\nso problematic contracts cannot be fixed by modifying the code in the\neducational blockchain.

Instead,\nthe (downside) semivariance, which captures the negative deviation of a random\nvariable under its mean, is more suitable for risk-averse proposes. This paper\naims at optimizing the mean-semivariance (MSV) criterion in reinforcement\nlearning w.r.t. steady reward distribution.

First, we explore the theory behind the\ngeneralization of hybrid models from the Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC)\nperspective. A consequence of our PAC guarantee is the existence of a sweet\nspot for the optimal transparency of the system.

In this paper, we show that if\nwe cast a contrastive objective equivalently into the feature space, then its\nlearning dynamics admits an interpretable form. Specifically, we show that its\ngradient descent corresponds to a specific message passing scheme on the\ncorresponding augmentation graph. Based on this perspective, we theoretically\ncharacterize how contrastive learning gradually learns discriminative features\nwith the alignment update and the uniformity update. Meanwhile, this\nperspective also establishes an intriguing connection between contrastive\nlearning and Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). This connection\nnot only provides a unified understanding of many techniques independently\ndeveloped in each community, but also enables us to borrow techniques from\nMP-GNNs to design new contrastive learning variants, such as graph attention,\ngraph rewiring, jumpy knowledge techniques, etc. We believe that our message\npassing perspective not only provides a new theoretical understanding of\ncontrastive learning dynamics, but also bridges the two seemingly independent\nareas together, which could inspire more interleaving studies to benefit from\neach other.

In object-oriented environments, predicates are a particularly useful\nform of state abstraction because of their compatibility with symbolic planners\nand their capacity for relational generalization. However, to plan with\npredicates, the agent must be able to interpret them in continuous environment\nstates (i.e., ground the symbols). Manually programming predicate\ninterpretations can be difficult, so we would instead like to learn them from\ndata. We propose an embodied active learning paradigm where the agent learns\npredicate interpretations through online interaction with an expert. For\nexample, after taking actions in a block stacking environment, the agent may\nask the expert: \"Is On(block1, block2) true?\" From this experience, the agent\nlearns to plan: it learns neural predicate interpretations, symbolic planning\noperators, and neural samplers that can be used for bilevel planning. During\nexploration, the agent plans to learn: it uses its current models to select\nactions towards generating informative expert queries.

Although successful on\nprevious missions, this approach is restricted to the specificity of the\ntemplates and limited by the fidelity of the underlying hazard map, which both\nrequire extensive pre-flight cost and effort to obtain and develop. Terrestrial\nsystems that perform a similar task in applications such as autonomous driving\nutilize state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to successfully localize and\nclassify navigation hazards. Advancements in spacecraft co-processors aimed at\naccelerating deep learning inference enable the application of these methods in\nspace for the first time. In this work, we introduce You Only Crash Once\n(YOCO), a deep learning-based visual hazardous terrain detection and\nclassification technique for autonomous spacecraft planetary landings. Through\nthe use of unsupervised domain adaptation we tailor YOCO for training by\nsimulation, removing the need for real-world annotated data and expensive\nmission surveying phases. We further improve the transfer of representative\nterrain knowledge between simulation and the real world through visual\nsimilarity clustering. We demonstrate the utility of YOCO through a series of\nterrestrial and extraterrestrial simulation-to-real experiments and show\nsubstantial improvements toward the ability to both detect and accurately\nclassify instances of planetary terrain.\n","authors":["Timothy Chase Jr","Chris Gnam","John Crassidis","Karthik Dantu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04891v1.pdf","comment":"To be published in proceedings of AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist\n  Conference 2022"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10609v2","updated":"2023-03-08T21:10:38Z","published":"2022-08-22T21:30:55Z","title":"Global Concept-Based Interpretability for Graph Neural Networks via\n  Neuron Analysis","summary":"  Graph neural networks (GNNs) are highly effective on a variety of\ngraph-related tasks; however, they lack interpretability and transparency.\nCurrent explainability approaches are typically local and treat GNNs as\nblack-boxes.

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the impact of\ndifferent choices of linear and nonlinear architectures on the implicit bias of\nthe learned features and the adversarial perturbations, in both spatial and\nfrequency domains. We find that the high-frequency adversarial perturbations\nare critically dependent on the convolution operation because the\nspatially-limited nature of local convolutions induces an implicit bias towards\nhigh frequency features.

However, we observe that when the e-graph is not\nsaturated, it cannot represent all possible rewrite opportunities and therefore\nthe phase-ordering problem is re-introduced during the construction phase of\nthe e-graph. To address this problem, we propose MCTS-GEB, a domain-general\nrewrite system that applies reinforcement learning (RL) to e-graph\nconstruction. At its core, MCTS-GEB uses a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) [3]\nto efficiently plan for the optimal e-graph construction, and therefore it can\neffectively eliminate the phase-ordering problem at the construction phase and\nachieve better performance within a reasonable time. Evaluation in two\ndifferent domains shows MCTS-GEB can outperform the state-of-the-art rewrite\nsystems by up to 49x, while the optimisation can generally take less than an\nhour, indicating MCTS-GEB is a promising building block for the future\ngeneration of rewrite systems.\n","authors":["Guoliang He","Zak Singh","Eiko Yoneki"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04651v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01616v2","updated":"2023-03-08T14:26:11Z","published":"2023-02-03T09:28:39Z","title":"A geometrically aware auto-encoder for multi-texture synthesis","summary":"  We propose an auto-encoder architecture for multi-texture synthesis.

Machine learning (ML) has\nbeen applied in various aspects of human resource management including\nattrition prediction to provide businesses with insights on proactive measures\non how to prevent talented employees from quitting. Among these ML methods, the\nbest performance has been reported by ensemble or deep neural networks, which\nby nature constitute black box techniques and thus cannot be easily\ninterpreted.

For\nexample, after taking actions in a block stacking environment, the agent may\nask the expert: \"Is On(block1, block2) true?\" From this experience, the agent\nlearns to plan: it learns neural predicate interpretations, symbolic planning\noperators, and neural samplers that can be used for bilevel planning.

Prior work has shown\nthat pretrained LMs can be taught to caption images when a vision model's\nparameters are optimized to encode images in the language space. We test a\nstronger hypothesis: that the conceptual representations learned by frozen\ntext-only models and vision-only models are similar enough that this can be\nachieved with a linear map. We show that the image representations from vision\nmodels can be transferred as continuous prompts to frozen LMs by training only\na single linear projection. Using these to prompt the LM achieves competitive\nperformance on captioning and visual question answering tasks compared to\nmodels that tune both the image encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA\nmodel). We compare three image encoders with increasing amounts of linguistic\nsupervision seen during pretraining: BEIT (no linguistic information),\nNF-ResNET (lexical category information), and CLIP (full natural language\ndescriptions). We find that all three encoders perform equally well at\ntransferring visual property information to the language model (e.g., whether\nan animal is large or small), but that image encoders pretrained with\nlinguistic supervision more saliently encode category information (e.g.,\ndistinguishing hippo vs. elephant) and thus perform significantly better on\nbenchmark language-and-vision tasks.

Particularly, it is\nunclear to what extent can inputs be perturbed while preserving legibility, or\nhow to quantify the legibility of a perturbed string. In this work, we address\nthis gap by learning models that predict the legibility of a perturbed string,\nand rank candidate perturbations based on their legibility. To do so, we\ncollect and release \\dataset, a human-annotated dataset comprising the\nlegibility of visually perturbed text.

However,\nvideo anomaly detection is particularly context-specific, and the availability\nof representative datasets heavily limits real-world accuracy. Additionally,\nthe metrics currently reported by most state-of-the-art methods often do not\nreflect how well the model will perform in real-world scenarios. In this\narticle, we present the Charlotte Anomaly Dataset (CHAD). CHAD is a\nhigh-resolution, multi-camera anomaly dataset in a commercial parking lot\nsetting. In addition to frame-level anomaly labels, CHAD is the first anomaly\ndataset to include bounding box, identity, and pose annotations for each actor.\nThis is especially beneficial for skeleton-based anomaly detection, which is\nuseful for its lower computational demand in real-world settings. CHAD is also\nthe first anomaly dataset to contain multiple views of the same scene. With\nfour camera views and over 1.15 million frames, CHAD is the largest fully\nannotated anomaly detection dataset including person annotations, collected\nfrom continuous video streams from stationary cameras for smart video\nsurveillance applications. To demonstrate the efficacy of CHAD for training and\nevaluation, we benchmark two state-of-the-art skeleton-based anomaly detection\nalgorithms on CHAD and provide comprehensive analysis, including both\nquantitative results and qualitative examination.

However, MAE solely reconstructs the low-level RGB\nsignals after the decoder and lacks supervision upon high-level semantics for\nthe encoder, thus suffering from sub-optimal learned representations and long\npre-training epochs. To alleviate this, previous methods simply replace the\npixel reconstruction targets of 75% masked tokens by encoded features from\npre-trained image-image (DINO) or image-language (CLIP) contrastive learning.\nDifferent from those efforts, we propose to Mimic before Reconstruct for Masked\nAutoencoders, named as MR-MAE, which jointly learns high-level and low-level\nrepresentations without interference during pre-training. For high-level\nsemantics, MR-MAE employs a mimic loss over 25% visible tokens from the encoder\nto capture the pre-trained patterns encoded in CLIP and DINO. For low-level\nstructures, we inherit the reconstruction loss in MAE to predict RGB pixel\nvalues for 75% masked tokens after the decoder. As MR-MAE applies high-level\nand low-level targets respectively at different partitions, the learning\nconflicts between them can be naturally overcome and contribute to superior\nvisual representations for various downstream tasks. On ImageNet-1K, the MR-MAE\nbase pre-trained for only 400 epochs achieves 85.8% top-1 accuracy after\nfine-tuning, surpassing the 1600-epoch MAE base by +2.2% and the previous\nstate-of-the-art BEiT V2 base by +0.3%.

Current\napproaches to image registration are generally based on the assumption that the\ncontent of the images is usually accessible in clear form, from which the\nspatial transformation is subsequently estimated. This common assumption may\nnot be met in practical applications, since the sensitive nature of medical\nimages may ultimately require their analysis under privacy constraints,\npreventing to openly share the image content.In this work, we formulate the\nproblem of image registration under a privacy preserving regime, where images\nare assumed to be confidential and cannot be disclosed in clear. We derive our\nprivacy preserving image registration framework by extending classical\nregistration paradigms to account for advanced cryptographic tools, such as\nsecure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption, that enable the\nexecution of operations without leaking the underlying data. To overcome the\nproblem of performance and scalability of cryptographic tools in high\ndimensions, we propose several techniques to optimize the image registration\noperations by using gradient approximations, and by revisiting the use of\nhomomorphic encryption trough packing, to allow the efficient encryption and\nmultiplication of large matrices.

If a test set has a drastically different difficulty level from the\ncalibration set, the optimal calibration parameters of the two datasets would\nbe different.

In the first stage, a multimodal masked\nautoencoder (M3AE) is proposed, where both random modalities (i.e., modality\ndropout) and random patches of the remaining modalities are masked for a\nreconstruction task, for self-supervised learning of robust multimodal\nrepresentations against missing modalities. To this end, we name our framework\nM3AE.

Recently, deep\nlearning methods have made it possible to improve the performance of cell\ndetection. However, a detection network trained with training data under a\nspecific condition (source domain) may not work well on data under other\nconditions (target domains), which is called the domain shift problem. In\nparticular, cells are cultured under different conditions depending on the\npurpose of the research. Characteristics, e.g., the shapes and density of the\ncells, change depending on the conditions, and such changes may cause domain\nshift problems. Here, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method for\ncell detection using a pseudo-cell-position heatmap, where the cell centroid is\nat the peak of a Gaussian distribution in the map and selective\npseudo-labeling. In the prediction result for the target domain, even if the\npeak location is correct, the signal distribution around the peak often has a\nnon-Gaussian shape. The pseudo-cell-position heatmap is thus re-generated using\nthe peak positions in the predicted heatmap to have a clear Gaussian shape. Our\nmethod selects confident pseudo-cell-position heatmaps based on uncertainty and\ncurriculum learning.

In\naddition, many works demonstrate that self-attention is actually a low-pass\nfilter, which is independent of input features or key/queries.

In this paper, we surprisingly find that improving\nthe reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers does not necessarily improve the\ngeneration. Instead, learning to compress semantic features within VQ\ntokenizers significantly improves generative transformers' ability to capture\ntextures and structures. We thus highlight two competing objectives of VQ\ntokenizers for image synthesis: semantic compression and details preservation.\nDifferent from previous work that only pursues better details preservation, we\npropose Semantic-Quantized GAN (SeQ-GAN) with two learning phases to balance\nthe two objectives. In the first phase, we propose a semantic-enhanced\nperceptual loss for better semantic compression.

In many\ncases the rough location may be known and a UAV can be deployed to explore a\ngiven, confined area to precisely localize the missing people. Due to time and\nbattery constraints it is often critical that localization is performed as\nefficiently as possible. In this work we approach this type of problem by\nabstracting it as an aerial view goal localization task in a framework that\nemulates a SAR-like setup without requiring access to actual UAVs. In this\nframework, an agent operates on top of an aerial image (proxy for a search\narea) and is tasked with localizing a goal that is described in terms of visual\ncues. To further mimic the situation on an actual UAV, the agent is not able to\nobserve the search area in its entirety, not even at low resolution, and thus\nit has to operate solely based on partial glimpses when navigating towards the\ngoal. To tackle this task, we propose AiRLoc, a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based model that decouples exploration (searching for distant goals) and\nexploitation (localizing nearby goals). Extensive evaluations show that AiRLoc\noutperforms heuristic search methods as well as alternative learnable\napproaches, and that it generalizes across datasets, e.g. to disaster-hit areas\nwithout seeing a single disaster scenario during training. We also conduct a\nproof-of-concept study which indicates that the learnable methods outperform\nhumans on average.

Second, an annotated RGBD dataset of five household objects\ngenerated using the proposed pipeline. Third, a real-time two-stage 6D pose\nestimation approach that integrates the object detector YOLO-V4 and a\nstreamlined, real-time version of the 6D pose estimation algorithm PVN3D\noptimized for time-sensitive robotics applications.

Diagnosing hair-related diseases is\ntime-consuming as it requires professional dermatologists to perform visual and\nmedical tests. Because of that, the overall diagnosis gets delayed, which\nworsens the severity of the illness.

To address this issue, we present a\nHybrid Dual Mean-Teacher (HD-Teacher) model with hybrid, semi-supervised, and\nmulti-task learning to achieve highly effective semi-supervised segmentation.\nHD-Teacher employs a 2D and a 3D mean-teacher network to produce segmentation\nlabels and signed distance fields from the hybrid information captured in both\ndimensionalities. This hybrid learning mechanism allows HD-Teacher to combine\nthe `best of both worlds', utilizing features extracted from either 2D, 3D, or\nboth dimensions to produce outputs as it sees fit. Outputs from 2D and 3D\nteacher models are also dynamically combined, based on their individual\nuncertainty scores, into a single hybrid prediction, where the hybrid\nuncertainty is estimated.

However, negative pairs used for training are sampled randomly, which\nindicates that the semantics between negative pairs may be related or even\nequivalent, while most methods still enforce dissimilar representations to\ndecrease their similarity. This phenomenon leads to inaccurate supervision and\npoor performance in learning video-text representations.\n  While most video retrieval methods overlook that phenomenon, we propose an\nadaptive margin changed with the distance between positive and negative pairs\nto solve the aforementioned issue.

In videos, the movements of the hand allow us to observe various parts\nof the hand that may be occluded or blurred in a single frame. To adaptively\nleverage the visual clue before and after the occlusion or blurring for robust\nhand pose estimation, we propose the Deformer: a framework that implicitly\nreasons about the relationship between hand parts within the same image\n(spatial dimension) and different timesteps (temporal dimension).

Recent work has\nachieved great overall performance by employing the segmentation from the\nprevious output. However, in most state-of-the-art approaches, 1) the inference\nstage involves inflexible heuristic rules and a separate refinement model; and\n2) the training cannot balance the number of user clicks and model performance.\nTo address the challenges, we propose a click-based and mask-guided interactive\nimage segmentation framework containing three novel components: Cascade-Forward\nRefinement (CFR), Iterative Click Loss (ICL), and SUEM image augmentation. The\nproposed ICL allows model training to improve segmentation and reduce user\ninteractions simultaneously. The CFR offers a unified inference framework to\ngenerate segmentation results in a coarse-to-fine manner. The proposed SUEM\naugmentation is a comprehensive way to create large and diverse training sets\nfor interactive image segmentation.

These\napproaches define a forward diffusion process for transforming data into noise\nand a backward denoising process for sampling data from noise. Unfortunately,\nthe generation process of current denoising diffusion models is notoriously\nslow due to the lengthy iterative noise estimations, which rely on cumbersome\nneural networks. It prevents the diffusion models from being widely deployed,\nespecially on edge devices. Previous works accelerate the generation process of\ndiffusion model (DM) via finding shorter yet effective sampling trajectories.\nHowever, they overlook the cost of noise estimation with a heavy network in\nevery iteration. In this work, we accelerate generation from the perspective of\ncompressing the noise estimation network. Due to the difficulty of retraining\nDMs, we exclude mainstream training-aware compression paradigms and introduce\npost-training quantization (PTQ) into DM acceleration. However, the output\ndistributions of noise estimation networks change with time-step, making\nprevious PTQ methods fail in DMs since they are designed for single-time step\nscenarios. To devise a DM-specific PTQ method, we explore PTQ on DM in three\naspects: quantized operations, calibration dataset, and calibration metric. We\nsummarize and use several observations derived from all-inclusive\ninvestigations to formulate our method, which especially targets the unique\nmulti-time-step structure of DMs. Experimentally, our method can directly\nquantize full-precision DMs into 8-bit models while maintaining or even\nimproving their performance in a training-free manner.

With DALL-E 2, auto-regressive and diffusion models became the new\nstandard for large-scale generative models overnight. This rapid shift raises a\nfundamental question: can we scale up GANs to benefit from large datasets like\nLAION? We find that na\\\"Ively increasing the capacity of the StyleGAN\narchitecture quickly becomes unstable. We introduce GigaGAN, a new GAN\narchitecture that far exceeds this limit, demonstrating GANs as a viable option\nfor text-to-image synthesis. GigaGAN offers three major advantages. First, it\nis orders of magnitude faster at inference time, taking only 0.13 seconds to\nsynthesize a 512px image. Second, it can synthesize high-resolution images, for\nexample, 16-megapixel pixels in 3.66 seconds. Finally, GigaGAN supports various\nlatent space editing applications such as latent interpolation, style mixing,\nand vector arithmetic operations.\n","authors":["Minguk Kang","Jun-Yan Zhu","Richard Zhang","Jaesik Park","Eli Shechtman","Sylvain Paris","Taesung Park"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05511v1.pdf","comment":"CVPR 2023.

Existing\nregularization techniques include broad modelling decisions such as choice of\narchitecture, loss functions, and optimization methods. In this work, we\nintroduce Tabular Neural Gradient Orthogonalization and Specialization\n(TANGOS), a novel framework for regularization in the tabular setting built on\nlatent unit attributions. The gradient attribution of an activation with\nrespect to a given input feature suggests how the neuron attends to that\nfeature, and is often employed to interpret the predictions of deep networks.\nIn TANGOS, we take a different approach and incorporate neuron attributions\ndirectly into training to encourage orthogonalization and specialization of\nlatent attributions in a fully-connected network. Our regularizer encourages\nneurons to focus on sparse, non-overlapping input features and results in a set\nof diverse and specialized latent units. In the tabular domain, we demonstrate\nthat our approach can lead to improved out-of-sample generalization\nperformance, outperforming other popular regularization methods.

Acute brain\ndysfunction status, delirium, is often underdiagnosed or undervalued. This\nstudy's objective was to develop automated computable phenotypes for acute\nbrain dysfunction states and describe transitions among brain dysfunction\nstates to illustrate the clinical trajectories of ICU patients. We created two\nsingle-center, longitudinal EHR datasets for 48,817 adult patients admitted to\nan ICU at UFH Gainesville (GNV) and Jacksonville (JAX). We developed algorithms\nto quantify acute brain dysfunction status including coma, delirium, normal, or\ndeath at 12-hour intervals of each ICU admission and to identify acute brain\ndysfunction phenotypes using continuous acute brain dysfunction status and\nk-means clustering approach. There were 49,770 admissions for 37,835 patients\nin UFH GNV dataset and 18,472 admissions for 10,982 patients in UFH JAX\ndataset. In total, 18% of patients had coma as the worst brain dysfunction\nstatus; every 12 hours, around 4%-7% would transit to delirium, 22%-25% would\nrecover, 3%-4% would expire, and 67%-68% would remain in a coma in the ICU.\nAdditionally, 7% of patients had delirium as the worst brain dysfunction\nstatus; around 6%-7% would transit to coma, 40%-42% would be no delirium, 1%\nwould expire, and 51%-52% would remain delirium in the ICU. There were three\nphenotypes: persistent coma/delirium, persistently normal, and transition from\ncoma/delirium to normal almost exclusively in first 48 hours after ICU\nadmission. We developed phenotyping scoring algorithms that determined acute\nbrain dysfunction status every 12 hours while admitted to the ICU.

Estimating\nthese unknowns, which has traditionally required model fitting - an often\niterative procedure, can now be done with one-shot machine learning (ML)\napproaches. Such parameter estimation may be complicated by intrinsic qMRI\nsignal model degeneracy: different combinations of tissue properties produce\nthe same signal. Despite their many advantages, it remains unclear whether ML\napproaches can resolve this issue. Growing empirical evidence appears to\nsuggest ML approaches remain susceptible to model degeneracy. Here we\ndemonstrate under the right circumstances ML can address this issue. Inspired\nby recent works on the impact of training data distributions on ML-based\nparameter estimation, we propose to resolve model degeneracy by designing\ntraining data distributions.

However, instantaneous dependence is prevalent in many RL environments.\nFor instance, in the stock market, instantaneous dependence can exist between\ntwo stocks because the fluctuation of one stock can quickly affect the other\nand the resolution of price change is lower than that of the effect. In this\npaper, we prove that with few exceptions, ignoring instantaneous dependence can\nresult in suboptimal policy learning in MBRL.

It is difficult for operators to obtain accurate\nday-ahead forecasts of renewable generation, thereby requiring the future\nscheduling system to make real-time scheduling decisions aligning with\nultra-short-term forecasts. Restricted by the computation speed, traditional\noptimization-based methods can not solve this problem. Recent developments in\nreinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the potential to solve this\nchallenge.

In\norder to gain understanding of this implicit bias phenomenon we study the\nspecial case of sparse recovery (compressed sensing) which is of interest on\nits own. More precisely, in order to reconstruct a vector from underdetermined\nlinear measurements, we introduce a corresponding overparameterized square loss\nfunctional, where the vector to be reconstructed is deeply factorized into\nseveral vectors. We show that, if there exists an exact solution, vanilla\ngradient flow for the overparameterized loss functional converges to a good\napproximation of the solution of minimal $\\ell_1$-norm. The latter is\nwell-known to promote sparse solutions. As a by-product, our results\nsignificantly improve the sample complexity for compressed sensing via gradient\nflow/descent on overparameterized models derived in previous works.

In many\ncases the rough location may be known and a UAV can be deployed to explore a\ngiven, confined area to precisely localize the missing people. Due to time and\nbattery constraints it is often critical that localization is performed as\nefficiently as possible. In this work we approach this type of problem by\nabstracting it as an aerial view goal localization task in a framework that\nemulates a SAR-like setup without requiring access to actual UAVs. In this\nframework, an agent operates on top of an aerial image (proxy for a search\narea) and is tasked with localizing a goal that is described in terms of visual\ncues. To further mimic the situation on an actual UAV, the agent is not able to\nobserve the search area in its entirety, not even at low resolution, and thus\nit has to operate solely based on partial glimpses when navigating towards the\ngoal. To tackle this task, we propose AiRLoc, a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based model that decouples exploration (searching for distant goals) and\nexploitation (localizing nearby goals). Extensive evaluations show that AiRLoc\noutperforms heuristic search methods as well as alternative learnable\napproaches, and that it generalizes across datasets, e.g. to disaster-hit areas\nwithout seeing a single disaster scenario during training.

To address above\nchallenges, we systematically summarize the distribution shift in TSF into two\ncategories. Regarding lookback windows as input-space and horizon windows as\noutput-space, there exist (i) intra-space shift, that the distribution within\nthe input-space keeps shifted over time, and (ii) inter-space shift, that the\ndistribution is shifted between input-space and output-space. Then we\nintroduce, Dish-TS, a general neural paradigm for alleviating distribution\nshift in TSF. Specifically, for better distribution estimation, we propose the\ncoefficient net (CONET), which can be any neural architectures, to map input\nsequences into learnable distribution coefficients. To relieve intra-space and\ninter-space shift, we organize Dish-TS as a Dual-CONET framework to separately\nlearn the distribution of input- and output-space, which naturally captures the\ndistribution difference of two spaces. In addition, we introduce a more\neffective training strategy for intractable CONET learning.

However, there is still a need to bridge the gap between what\nRNNs are capable of in terms of efficiency and performance and real-world\napplication requirements. The memory and computational requirements arising\nfrom propagating the activations of all the neurons at every time step to every\nconnected neuron, together with the sequential dependence of activations,\ncontribute to the inefficiency of training and using RNNs. We propose a\nsolution inspired by biological neuron dynamics that makes the communication\nbetween RNN units sparse and discrete. This makes the backward pass with\nbackpropagation through time (BPTT) computationally sparse and efficient as\nwell. We base our model on the gated recurrent unit (GRU), extending it with\nunits that emit discrete events for communication triggered by a threshold so\nthat no information is communicated to other units in the absence of events.

This is particularly useful in modeling medical systems where data can\nbe leveraged to individualize treatment. In safety-critical applications, it is\nimportant that the data-driven model is conformant to established knowledge\nfrom the natural sciences. Such knowledge is often available or can often be\ndistilled into a (possibly black-box) model $M$. For instance, the unicycle\nmodel (which encodes Newton's laws) for an F1 racing car. In this light, we\nconsider the following problem - given a model $M$ and state transition\ndataset, we wish to best approximate the system model while being bounded\ndistance away from $M$. We propose a method to guarantee this conformance. Our\nfirst step is to distill the dataset into few representative samples called\nmemories, using the idea of a growing neural gas. Next, using these memories we\npartition the state space into disjoint subsets and compute bounds that should\nbe respected by the neural network, when the input is drawn from a particular\nsubset. This serves as a symbolic wrapper for guaranteed conformance.

Our regularizer encourages\nneurons to focus on sparse, non-overlapping input features and results in a set\nof diverse and specialized latent units. In the tabular domain, we demonstrate\nthat our approach can lead to improved out-of-sample generalization\nperformance, outperforming other popular regularization methods. We provide\ninsight into why our regularizer is effective and demonstrate that TANGOS can\nbe applied jointly with existing methods to achieve even greater generalization\nperformance.\n","authors":["Alan Jeffares","Tennison Liu","Jonathan CrabbÃ©","Fergus Imrie","Mihaela van der Schaar"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05506v1.pdf","comment":"Published at International Conference on Learning Representations\n  (ICLR) 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05503v1","updated":"2023-03-09T18:55:03Z","published":"2023-03-09T18:55:03Z","title":"Open-world Instance Segmentation: Top-down Learning with Bottom-up\n  Supervision","summary":"  Many top-down architectures for instance segmentation achieve significant\nsuccess when trained and tested on pre-defined closed-world taxonomy.

In this work, we propose a novel\napproach for open world instance segmentation called bottom-Up and top-Down\nOpen-world Segmentation (UDOS) that combines classical bottom-up segmentation\nalgorithms within a top-down learning framework. UDOS first predicts parts of\nobjects using a top-down network trained with weak supervision from bottom-up\nsegmentations.

However, several\nexisting offline RL methods tend to exhibit poor online fine-tuning\nperformance.

In this paper, we devise an approach for learning an effective\ninitialization from offline data that also enables fast online fine-tuning\ncapabilities. Our approach, calibrated Q-learning (Cal-QL) accomplishes this by\nlearning a conservative value function initialization that underestimates the\nvalue of the learned policy from offline data, while also being calibrated, in\nthe sense that the learned Q-values are at a reasonable scale. We refer to this\nproperty as calibration, and define it formally as providing a lower bound on\nthe true value function of the learned policy and an upper bound on the value\nof some other (suboptimal) reference policy, which may simply be the behavior\npolicy. We show that offline RL algorithms that learn such calibrated value\nfunctions lead to effective online fine-tuning, enabling us to take the\nbenefits of offline initializations in online fine-tuning. In practice, Cal-QL\ncan be implemented on top of existing conservative methods for offline RL\nwithin a one-line code change.

Current\napproaches to image registration are generally based on the assumption that the\ncontent of the images is usually accessible in clear form, from which the\nspatial transformation is subsequently estimated. This common assumption may\nnot be met in practical applications, since the sensitive nature of medical\nimages may ultimately require their analysis under privacy constraints,\npreventing to openly share the image content.In this work, we formulate the\nproblem of image registration under a privacy preserving regime, where images\nare assumed to be confidential and cannot be disclosed in clear.

To overcome the\nproblem of performance and scalability of cryptographic tools in high\ndimensions, we propose several techniques to optimize the image registration\noperations by using gradient approximations, and by revisiting the use of\nhomomorphic encryption trough packing, to allow the efficient encryption and\nmultiplication of large matrices.

The 11th\nInternational Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software\n(ThEdu'22), was a satellite event of the 8th Federated Logic Conference (FLoC\n2022), July 31-August 12, 2022, Haifa, Israel ThEdu'22 was a vibrant workshop,\nwith two invited talk by Thierry Dana-Picard (Jerusalem College of Technology,\nJerusalem, Israel) and Yoni Zohar (Bar Ilan University, Tel Aviv, Israel) and\nfour contributions. An open call for papers was then issued, and attracted\nseven submissions. Those submissions have been accepted by our reviewers, who\njointly produced at least three careful reports on each of the contributions.\nThe resulting revised papers are collected in the present volume. The\ncontributions in this volume are a faithful representation of the wide spectrum\nof ThEdu, ranging from those more focused on the automated deduction research,\nnot losing track of the possible applications in an educational setting, to\nthose focused on the applications, in educational settings, of automated\ndeduction tools and methods.

However, in many settings, giving\none type of feedback (e.g. a demonstration) may be much more difficult than a\ndifferent type of feedback (e.g. answering a comparison query). Thus, we expect\nto see more or less noise depending on the type of human feedback. In this\nwork, we advocate that grounding the rationality coefficient in real data for\neach feedback type, rather than assuming a default value, has a significant\npositive effect on reward learning. We test this in both simulated experiments\nand in a user study with real human feedback. We find that overestimating human\nrationality can have dire effects on reward learning accuracy and regret. We\nalso find that fitting the rationality coefficient to human data enables better\nreward learning, even when the human deviates significantly from the\nnoisy-rational choice model due to systematic biases. Further, we find that the\nrationality level affects the informativeness of each feedback type:\nsurprisingly, demonstrations are not always the most informative -- when the\nhuman acts very suboptimally, comparisons actually become more informative,\neven when the rationality level is the same for both. Ultimately, our results\nemphasize the importance and advantage of paying attention to the assumed\nhuman-rationality level, especially when agents actively learn from multiple\ntypes of human feedback.\n","authors":["Gaurav R.

However, the performance of\nexisting few-shot VRD models is severely hampered by the poor generalization\ncapability, as they struggle to handle the vast semantic diversity of visual\nrelationships. Nonetheless, humans have the ability to learn new relationships\nwith just few examples based on their knowledge.

Previous\nstudies have succeeded in re-creating different aspects of the visuals, such as\nlow-level properties (shape, texture, layout) or high-level features (category\nof objects, descriptive semantics of scenes) but have typically failed to\nreconstruct these properties together for complex scene images. Generative AI\nhas recently made a leap forward with latent diffusion models capable of\ngenerating high-complexity images. Here, we investigate how to take advantage\nof this innovative technology for brain decoding. We present a two-stage scene\nreconstruction framework called ``Brain-Diffuser''. In the first stage,\nstarting from fMRI signals, we reconstruct images that capture low-level\nproperties and overall layout using a VDVAE (Very Deep Variational Autoencoder)\nmodel. In the second stage, we use the image-to-image framework of a latent\ndiffusion model (Versatile Diffusion) conditioned on predicted multimodal (text\nand visual) features, to generate final reconstructed images. On the publicly\navailable Natural Scenes Dataset benchmark, our method outperforms previous\nmodels both qualitatively and quantitatively. When applied to synthetic fMRI\npatterns generated from individual ROI (region-of-interest) masks, our trained\nmodel creates compelling ``ROI-optimal'' scenes consistent with neuroscientific\nknowledge.

Being able to train effectively in increasingly complicated\nscenarios with reinforcement learning enables to take advantage of complex\nsystems such as soft robots. Here, we leverage the imbalance in complexity of\nthe dynamics to learn more sample-efficiently.

They are trained with\nloss functions that are computed considering a batch of scored triples and\ntheir corresponding labels. Traditional approaches consider the label of a\ntriple to be either true or false. However, recent works suggest that all\nnegative triples should not be valued equally. In line with this recent\nassumption, we posit that semantically valid negative triples might be\nhigh-quality negative triples. As such, loss functions should treat them\ndifferently from semantically invalid negative ones. To this aim, we propose\nsemantic-driven versions for the three main loss functions for link prediction.\nIn particular, we treat the scores of negative triples differently by injecting\nbackground knowledge about relation domains and ranges into the loss functions.\nIn an extensive and controlled experimental setting, we show that the proposed\nloss functions systematically provide satisfying results on three public\nbenchmark KGs underpinned with different schemas, which demonstrates both the\ngenerality and superiority of our proposed approach. In fact, the proposed loss\nfunctions do (1) lead to better MRR and Hits@$10$ values, (2) drive KGEMs\ntowards better semantic awareness. This highlights that semantic information\nglobally improves KGEMs, and thus should be incorporated into loss functions.\nDomains and ranges of relations being largely available in schema-defined KGs,\nthis makes our approach both beneficial and widely usable in practice.\n","authors":["Nicolas Hubert","Pierre Monnin","Armelle Brun","Davy Monticolo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00286v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05246v1","updated":"2023-03-09T13:33:36Z","published":"2023-03-09T13:33:36Z","title":"Efficient Certified Training and Robustness Verification of Neural ODEs","summary":"  Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) are a novel neural\narchitecture, built around initial value problems with learned dynamics which\nare solved during inference.

However, defining a\ngood choice of hyperparameters is a challenging problem.\n  Hyperparameter tuning often requires manual or automated searches to find\noptimal values. Nonetheless, a noticeable limitation is the high cost of\nalgorithm evaluation for complex models, making the tuning process\ncomputationally expensive and time-consuming.\n  In this paper, we propose a framework based on integrating complex event\nprocessing and temporal models, to alleviate these trade-offs. Through this\ncombination, it is possible to gain insights about a running RL system\nefficiently and unobtrusively based on data stream monitoring and to create\nabstract representations that allow reasoning about the historical behaviour of\nthe RL system. The obtained knowledge is exploited to provide feedback to the\nRL system for optimising its hyperparameters while making effective use of\nparallel resources.\n  We introduce a novel history-aware epsilon-greedy logic for hyperparameter\noptimisation that instead of using static hyperparameters that are kept fixed\nfor the whole training, adjusts the hyperparameters at runtime based on the\nanalysis of the agent's performance over time windows in a single agent's\nlifetime. We tested the proposed approach in a 5G mobile communications case\nstudy that uses DQN, a variant of RL, for its decision-making.

To address above\nchallenges, we systematically summarize the distribution shift in TSF into two\ncategories. Regarding lookback windows as input-space and horizon windows as\noutput-space, there exist (i) intra-space shift, that the distribution within\nthe input-space keeps shifted over time, and (ii) inter-space shift, that the\ndistribution is shifted between input-space and output-space. Then we\nintroduce, Dish-TS, a general neural paradigm for alleviating distribution\nshift in TSF. Specifically, for better distribution estimation, we propose the\ncoefficient net (CONET), which can be any neural architectures, to map input\nsequences into learnable distribution coefficients. To relieve intra-space and\ninter-space shift, we organize Dish-TS as a Dual-CONET framework to separately\nlearn the distribution of input- and output-space, which naturally captures the\ndistribution difference of two spaces.

These concerns arise from the need for huge amounts of\ndata to train deep neural networks. A promise of Generalized Few-shot Object\nDetection (G-FSOD), a learning paradigm in AI, is to alleviate the need for\ncollecting abundant training samples of novel classes we wish to detect by\nleveraging prior knowledge from old classes (i.e., base classes). G-FSOD\nstrives to learn these novel classes while alleviating catastrophic forgetting\nof the base classes. However, existing approaches assume that the base images\nare accessible, an assumption that does not hold when sharing and storing data\nis problematic. In this work, we propose the first data-free knowledge\ndistillation (DFKD) approach for G-FSOD that leverages the statistics of the\nregion of interest (RoI) features from the base model to forge instance-level\nfeatures without accessing the base images. Our contribution is three-fold: (1)\nwe design a standalone lightweight generator with (2) class-wise heads (3) to\ngenerate and replay diverse instance-level base features to the RoI head while\nfinetuning on the novel data. This stands in contrast to standard DFKD\napproaches in image classification, which invert the entire network to generate\nbase images. Moreover, we make careful design choices in the novel finetuning\npipeline to regularize the model. We show that our approach can dramatically\nreduce the base memory requirements, all while setting a new standard for\nG-FSOD on the challenging MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC benchmarks.\n","authors":["Karim Guirguis","Johannes Meier","George Eskandar","Matthias Kayser","Bin Yang","Juergen Beyerer"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04958v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted at CVPR 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03609v4","updated":"2023-03-09T00:21:41Z","published":"2022-02-08T02:49:09Z","title":"Backdoor Detection and Mitigation in Competitive Reinforcement Learning","summary":"  While real-world applications of reinforcement learning are becoming popular,\nthe security and robustness of RL systems are worthy of more attention and\nexploration.

The memory and computational requirements arising\nfrom propagating the activations of all the neurons at every time step to every\nconnected neuron, together with the sequential dependence of activations,\ncontribute to the inefficiency of training and using RNNs. We propose a\nsolution inspired by biological neuron dynamics that makes the communication\nbetween RNN units sparse and discrete. This makes the backward pass with\nbackpropagation through time (BPTT) computationally sparse and efficient as\nwell.

We propose a method to guarantee this conformance. Our\nfirst step is to distill the dataset into few representative samples called\nmemories, using the idea of a growing neural gas.

In recent years, researchers have introduced\nobjectives and corresponding reinforcement-learning algorithms beyond the\nclassic cumulative rewards, such as objectives specified as linear temporal\nlogic formulas. However, questions about the PAC-learnability of these new\nobjectives have remained open.\n  This work demonstrates the PAC-learnability of general reinforcement-learning\nobjectives through sufficient conditions for PAC-learnability in two analysis\nsettings. In particular, for the analysis that considers only sample\ncomplexity, we prove that if an objective given as an oracle is uniformly\ncontinuous, then it is PAC-learnable. Further, for the analysis that considers\ncomputational complexity, we prove that if an objective is computable, then it\nis PAC-learnable. In other words, if a procedure computes successive\napproximations of the objective's value, then the objective is PAC-learnable.\n  We give three applications of our condition on objectives from the literature\nwith previously unknown PAC-learnability and prove that these objectives are\nPAC-learnable. Overall, our result helps verify existing objectives'\nPAC-learnability. Also, as some studied objectives that are not uniformly\ncontinuous have been shown to be not PAC-learnable, our results could guide the\ndesign of new PAC-learnable objectives.\n","authors":["Cambridge Yang","Michael Littman","Michael Carbin"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05518v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05517v1","updated":"2023-03-09T13:27:54Z","published":"2023-03-09T13:27:54Z","title":"On the Soundness of XAI in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)","summary":"  The aim of Predictive Maintenance, within the field of Prognostics and Health\nManagement (PHM), is to identify and anticipate potential issues in the\nequipment before these become critical.

Texts from a wide\nrange of sources are examined by a sentiment analysis tool, which extracts\nmeaning from them, including emails, surveys, reviews, social media posts, and\nweb articles. To evaluate sentiments, natural language processing (NLP) and\nmachine learning techniques are used, which assign weights to entities, topics,\nthemes, and categories in sentences or phrases. Machine learning tools learn\nhow to detect sentiment without human intervention by examining examples of\nemotions in text. In a pandemic situation, analyzing social media texts to\nuncover sentimental trends can be very helpful in gaining a better\nunderstanding of society's needs and predicting future trends. We intend to\nstudy society's perception of the COVID-19 pandemic through social media using\nstate-of-the-art BERT and Deep CNN models. The superiority of BERT models over\nother deep models in sentiment analysis is evident and can be concluded from\nthe comparison of the various research studies mentioned in this article.\n","authors":["Javad Hassannataj Joloudari","Sadiq Hussain","Mohammad Ali Nematollahi","Rouhollah Bagheri","Fatemeh Fazl","Roohallah Alizadehsani","Reza Lashgari","Ashis Talukder"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09733v2.pdf","comment":"20 pages, 5 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05759v1","updated":"2023-03-10T07:55:00Z","published":"2023-03-10T07:55:00Z","title":"An Overview on Language Models: Recent Developments and Outlook","summary":"  Language modeling studies the probability distributions over strings of\ntexts.

However, they tend to perform poorly in\nout-of-distribution evaluation scenarios, a challenge that Unsupervised Domain\nGeneralization (UDG) seeks to address.\n  This paper introduces a novel method to standardize the styles of images in a\nbatch. Batch styles standardization, relying on Fourier-based augmentations,\npromotes domain invariance in SSL by preventing spurious correlations from\nleaking into the features. The combination of batch styles standardization with\nthe well-known contrastive-based method SimCLR leads to a novel UDG method\nnamed CLaSSy ($\\textbf{C}$ontrastive $\\textbf{L}$e$\\textbf{a}$rning with\n$\\textbf{S}$tandardized $\\textbf{S}$t$\\textbf{y}$les). CLaSSy offers serious\nadvantages over prior methods, as it does not rely on domain labels and is\nscalable to handle a large number of domains. Experimental results on various\nUDG datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CLaSSy compared to\nexisting UDG methods.

However, reducing interdependence helps release the input\nconstraint while weakening the mutual reasoning about reconstructing the\ninteracting hands. Thus, based on center attention, ACR also learns cross-hand\nprior that handle the interacting hands better. We evaluate our method on\nvarious types of hand reconstruction datasets. Our method significantly\noutperforms the best interacting-hand approaches on the InterHand2.6M dataset\nwhile yielding comparable performance with the state-of-the-art single-hand\nmethods on the FreiHand dataset. More qualitative results on in-the-wild and\nhand-object interaction datasets and web images/videos further demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach for arbitrary hand reconstruction.

Existing OSDA methods suffer from two\nobstacles. First, a tedious process of manually tuning a hyperparameter\n$threshold$ is required for most OSDA approaches to separate common and unknown\nclasses. It is difficult to determine a proper threshold when the target domain\ndata is unlabeled. Second, most OSDA methods only rely on confidence values\npredicted by models to distinguish common/unknown classes. The performance is\nnot satisfied, especially when the majority of the target domain consists of\nunknown classes. Our experiments demonstrate that combining entropy,\nconsistency, and confidence is a more reliable way of distinguishing common and\nunknown samples. In this paper, we design a novel threshold self-tuning and\ncross-domain mixup (TSCM) method to overcome the two drawbacks. TSCM can\nautomatically tune a proper threshold utilizing unlabeled target samples rather\nthan manually setting an empirical hyperparameter. Our method considers\nmultiple criteria instead of only the confidence and uses the threshold\ngenerated by itself to separate common and unknown classes in the target\ndomain.

Recent studies leverage the advantage\nof self-attention in visual Transformer for long-range dependency to re-active\nsemantic regions, aiming to avoid partial activation in traditional class\nactivation mapping (CAM). However, the long-range modeling in Transformer\nneglects the inherent spatial coherence of the object, and it usually diffuses\nthe semantic-aware regions far from the object boundary, making localization\nresults significantly larger or far smaller. To address such an issue, we\nintroduce a simple yet effective Spatial Calibration Module (SCM) for accurate\nWSOL, incorporating semantic similarities of patch tokens and their spatial\nrelationships into a unified diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a\nlearnable parameter to dynamically adjust the semantic correlations and spatial\ncontext intensities for effective information propagation. In practice, SCM is\ndesigned as an external module of Transformer, and can be removed during\ninference to reduce the computation cost. The object-sensitive localization\nability is implicitly embedded into the Transformer encoder through\noptimization in the training phase. It enables the generated attention maps to\ncapture the sharper object boundaries and filter the object-irrelevant\nbackground area.

We present a systematic benchmarking setup and perform a\nrigorous comparison of different coreset selection methods on CNNs and\ntransformers. Our investigation reveals that under certain circumstances,\nrandom selection of subsets is more robust and stable when compared with the\nSOTA selection methods.

We further show that\nwhen no pretraining is done or when the pretrained transformer models are used\nwith non-natural images (e.g. medical data), CNNs tend to generalize better\nthan transformers at even very small coreset sizes.

What are the adversarial targets that such Trojan attacks can\nachieve? To answer these questions, we propose an effective Trojan attack\nagainst diffusion models, TrojDiff, which optimizes the Trojan diffusion and\ngenerative processes during training. In particular, we design novel\ntransitions during the Trojan diffusion process to diffuse adversarial targets\ninto a biased Gaussian distribution and propose a new parameterization of the\nTrojan generative process that leads to an effective training objective for the\nattack. In addition, we consider three types of adversarial targets: the\nTrojaned diffusion models will always output instances belonging to a certain\nclass from the in-domain distribution (In-D2D attack), out-of-domain\ndistribution (Out-D2D-attack), and one specific instance (D2I attack).

Recent studies show that insufficient training\ncaused by the lack of large-scale available sign language datasets becomes the\nmain bottleneck for SLR. The majority of SLR works thereby adopt pretrained\nvisual modules and develop two mainstream solutions. The multi-stream\narchitectures extend multi-cue visual features, yielding the current SOTA\nperformances but requiring complex designs and might introduce potential noise.\nAlternatively, the advanced single-cue SLR frameworks using explicit\ncross-modal alignment between visual and textual modalities are simple and\neffective, potentially competitive with the multi-cue framework. In this work,\nwe propose a novel contrastive visual-textual transformation for SLR, CVT-SLR,\nto fully explore the pretrained knowledge of both the visual and language\nmodalities. Based on the single-cue cross-modal alignment framework, we propose\na variational autoencoder (VAE) for pretrained contextual knowledge while\nintroducing the complete pretrained language module. The VAE implicitly aligns\nvisual and textual modalities while benefiting from pretrained contextual\nknowledge as the traditional contextual module. Meanwhile, a contrastive\ncross-modal alignment algorithm is proposed to further enhance the explicit\nconsistency constraints.

This work proposes a\nprobabilistic modeling approach that models the intraday price difference to\nthe day-ahead contracts. The model captures the emerging hourly pattern by\nconsidering the four 15 min intervals in each day-ahead price interval as a\nfour-dimensional joint probability distribution.

However, the\nsegmentation performance might be saturated and even degraded as the kernel\nsizes scaled up (e.g., $21\\times 21\\times 21$) in a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN). We hypothesize that convolution with LK sizes is limited to\nmaintain an optimal convergence for locality learning. While Structural\nRe-parameterization (SR) enhances the local convergence with small kernels in\nparallel, optimal small kernel branches may hinder the computational efficiency\nfor training. In this work, we propose RepUX-Net, a pure CNN architecture with\na simple large kernel block design, which competes favorably with current\nnetwork state-of-the-art (SOTA) (e.g., 3D UX-Net, SwinUNETR) using 6\nchallenging public datasets. We derive an equivalency between kernel\nre-parameterization and the branch-wise variation in kernel convergence.\nInspired by the spatial frequency in the human visual system, we extend to vary\nthe kernel convergence into element-wise setting and model the spatial\nfrequency as a Bayesian prior to re-parameterize convolutional weights during\ntraining.

To tune different components for DBMS, a coordinating mechanism is\nneeded to make the multiple agents cognizant of each other.

This study\ninvestigates how to measure, evaluate, and enhance prediction fairness between\ndisadvantaged and privileged communities in spatial-temporal demand forecasting\nof ride-hailing services. A two-pronged approach is taken to reduce the demand\nprediction bias. First, we develop a novel deep learning model architecture,\nnamed socially aware neural network (SA-Net), to integrate the\nsocio-demographics and ridership information for fair demand prediction through\nan innovative socially-aware convolution operation.

We\npropose a fully supervised generative framework that can achieve generalisable\nsegmentation with only limited labelled data by simultaneously constructing an\nexplorable manifold during training.

To understand these operational\nfailure modes, we develop a method, called DIstribution Shift DEcomposition\n(DISDE), to attribute a drop in performance to different types of distribution\nshifts. Our approach decomposes the performance drop into terms for 1) an\nincrease in harder but frequently seen examples from training, 2) changes in\nthe relationship between features and outcomes, and 3) poor performance on\nexamples infrequent or unseen during training. These terms are defined by\nfixing a distribution on $X$ while varying the conditional distribution of $Y\n\\mid X$ between training and target, or by fixing the conditional distribution\nof $Y \\mid X$ while varying the distribution on $X$. In order to do this, we\ndefine a hypothetical distribution on $X$ consisting of values common in both\ntraining and target, over which it is easy to compare $Y \\mid X$ and thus\npredictive performance. We estimate performance on this hypothetical\ndistribution via reweighting methods.

Existing works on this topic primarily focus on improving the\noverall estimation accuracy of a particular method and ignore the underlying\nchallenges of volume estimation, thereby having inferior performances on some\ncritical tasks. This paper studies two key problems with regard to traffic\nvolume estimation: (1) underdetermined traffic flows caused by undetected\nmovements, and (2) non-equilibrium traffic flows arise from congestion\npropagation. Here we demonstrate a graph-based deep learning method that can\noffer a data-driven, model-free and correlation adaptive approach to tackle the\nabove issues and perform accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation.\nParticularly, in order to quantify the dynamic and nonlinear relationships\nbetween traffic speed and volume for the estimation of underdetermined flows, a\nspeed patternadaptive adjacent matrix based on graph attention is developed and\nintegrated into the graph convolution process, to capture non-local\ncorrelations between sensors. To measure the impacts of non-equilibrium flows,\na temporal masked and clipped attention combined with a gated temporal\nconvolution layer is customized to capture time-asynchronous correlations\nbetween upstream and downstream sensors. We then evaluate our model on a\nreal-world highway traffic volume dataset and compare it with several benchmark\nmodels. It is demonstrated that the proposed model achieves high estimation\naccuracy even under 20% sensor coverage rate and outperforms other baselines\nsignificantly, especially on underdetermined and non-equilibrium flow\nlocations.

So far, existing methods\nfor uncovering such artifactual behavior in trained models focus on finding\nartifacts in the input data, which requires both availability of a data set and\nhuman supervision. In this paper, we introduce DORA (Data-agnOstic\nRepresentation Analysis): the first data-agnostic framework for the analysis of\nthe representation space of DNNs.

Due to the often complicated interplay of\nthe parameters, setting these values right for a particular problem (parameter\ntuning) is a challenging task. This task becomes even more complicated when the\noptimal parameter values change significantly during the run of the algorithm\nsince then a dynamic parameter choice (parameter control) is necessary.\n  In this work, we propose a lazy but effective solution, namely choosing all\nparameter values (where this makes sense) in each iteration randomly from a\nsuitably scaled power-law distribution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthis approach, we perform runtime analyses of the $(1+(\\lambda,\\lambda))$\ngenetic algorithm with all three parameters chosen in this manner. We show that\nthis algorithm on the one hand can imitate simple hill-climbers like the\n$(1+1)$ EA, giving the same asymptotic runtime on problems like OneMax,\nLeadingOnes, or Minimum Spanning Tree. On the other hand, this algorithm is\nalso very efficient on jump functions, where the best static parameters are\nvery different from those necessary to optimize simple problems. We prove a\nperformance guarantee that is comparable to the best performance known for\nstatic parameters.

Specifically, QVRF defines a quantization regulator vector\ncoupled with predefined Lagrange multipliers to control quantization error of\nall latent representation for discrete variable rates. Additionally, the\nreparameterization method makes QVRF compatible with a round quantizer.\nExhaustive experiments demonstrate that existing fixed-rate VAE-based methods\nequipped with QVRF can achieve wide-range continuous variable rates within a\nsingle model without significant performance degradation.

Recent studies show that insufficient training\ncaused by the lack of large-scale available sign language datasets becomes the\nmain bottleneck for SLR. The majority of SLR works thereby adopt pretrained\nvisual modules and develop two mainstream solutions. The multi-stream\narchitectures extend multi-cue visual features, yielding the current SOTA\nperformances but requiring complex designs and might introduce potential noise.\nAlternatively, the advanced single-cue SLR frameworks using explicit\ncross-modal alignment between visual and textual modalities are simple and\neffective, potentially competitive with the multi-cue framework. In this work,\nwe propose a novel contrastive visual-textual transformation for SLR, CVT-SLR,\nto fully explore the pretrained knowledge of both the visual and language\nmodalities. Based on the single-cue cross-modal alignment framework, we propose\na variational autoencoder (VAE) for pretrained contextual knowledge while\nintroducing the complete pretrained language module. The VAE implicitly aligns\nvisual and textual modalities while benefiting from pretrained contextual\nknowledge as the traditional contextual module. Meanwhile, a contrastive\ncross-modal alignment algorithm is proposed to further enhance the explicit\nconsistency constraints.

In recent years, researchers have begun to explore\nautomatic program translation using supervised deep learning techniques by\nlearning from large-scale parallel code corpus.

To address this issue, several unsupervised\nprogramming translation systems are proposed. However, these systems still rely\non huge monolingual source code to train, which is very expensive.

On two interactive decision making\nbenchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and\nreinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 10%\nrespectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.\nProject site with code: https://react-lm.github.io\n","authors":["Shunyu Yao","Jeffrey Zhao","Dian Yu","Nan Du","Izhak Shafran","Karthik Narasimhan","Yuan Cao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629v3.pdf","comment":"v3 is the ICLR camera ready version with some typos fixed.

In this paper, we provide analytic\nevidence that on large graphs, d-separation is a rare phenomenon, even when\nguaranteed to exist, unless the graph is extremely sparse. We then provide an\nanalytic average case analysis of the PC Algorithm for causal discovery, as\nwell as a variant of the SGS Algorithm we call UniformSGS. We consider a set\n$V=\\{v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\}$ of nodes, and generate a random DAG $G=(V,E)$ where\n$(v_a, v_b) \\in E$ with i.i.d. probability $p_1$ if $a<b$ and $0$ if $a > b$.\nWe provide upper bounds on the probability that a subset of $V-\\{x,y\\}$\nd-separates $x$ and $y$, conditional on $x$ and $y$ being d-separable; our\nupper bounds decay exponentially fast to $0$ as $|V| \\rightarrow \\infty$. For\nthe PC Algorithm, while it is known that its worst-case guarantees fail on\nnon-sparse graphs, we show that the same is true for the average case, and that\nthe sparsity requirement is quite demanding: for good performance, the density\nmust go to $0$ as $|V| \\rightarrow \\infty$ even in the average case. For\nUniformSGS, while it is known that the running time is exponential for existing\nedges, we show that in the average case, that is the expected running time for\nmost non-existing edges as well.\n","authors":["Itai Feigenbaum","Huan Wang","Shelby Heinecke","Juan Carlos Niebles","Weiran Yao","Caiming Xiong","Devansh Arpit"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05628v1.pdf","comment":null}]}}
